@BigAssBadger yeah I know  just don't get many channels round here.
Just looked at the freeview website and it turns out I'm not getting a lot of the channels it says I should be getting 
@gashead says I should be getting Dave, Dave ja vu, 4music and a load of others but I'm not  I'll try a rescan or something.

have been relegated to the kitchen to watch 8 out of 10 cats 
@Abcmsaj ah really? didnt get it 
@GeoffDicks yeah it's one of mine. Though I can't find the blog entry it's in now lol  yeah I take them on iPhone then edit them why?

@RabidDog I don't have that on my freeview yet  apparently my aerial is pointing to the wrong transmitter lol
I'm cold  my feet 'specially. They might fall off. I kind of need them for things.
Love how I put the thinner duvet on as it's been so warm and now tonight it's FREEZING  time to snuggle down as best I can. N'night. X
@coy0te True. He wasn't a very nice mini cat though, we kept losing him &amp; I was scared of his kittens cos I hate spiders 
@coy0te I have been having the WEIRDEST dreams since I've been on these tablets. Seriously. Keep meaning to blog them. Dream meanings? No 
@coy0te haha you're sounding more and more like something of man-izer! Hmm that doesn't work as well as womanizer 
Naw they had some cute little baby bunnies but they were English breed, so too big  http://twitpic.com/6tqw8
Now I don't feel well 
Just fell in love with a little albino baby in bunny in Now4Pets! He was adorable and jumped up and us and everything! Can't get him now 
@michmahoney we haven't got our other bunny neutered yet and we don't have another hutch 
Miss my Yoshi already and he's not even mine

@Redmanthinks I only really got fully in to it around halfway through S4 so wouldn't really know 
@joek949 1st had a software problem, 2nd the silent button broke and 3rd got nicked! 
@joek949 it really is 
Yoshi's still holding his leg a bit awkwardly 
@smmithyyy and it has a gorgeous UI, but it was buggered by OS3.0 and the twitpocalypse 
@Mr_Geoff aw no  sorry to hear that my dear. I know how crappy not being able to sleep well is!
Sodding muscular agony waking me up when I'm this tired! Smell of Deep Heat making me feel ill and I'm too hot! Help 
I need a wee. And food. And I wanna go see my ickle babies. Had a dream about them last night. Had 2of each&amp;one was evil 
It was a year ago today we waved my sister goodbye as she left to live in Oz for 3years

@josianna Not so sure he'll love the idea of having his bits chopped off to start with lol. Dads said we might get 1or2 more baby bunnies 
@Mr_Geoff  I love that show! Don't you???
@totalgunner He is  very nibbly though, can't hold him for long if I want my clothes intact lol hence maybe neutering him.
