@joek949 Morning... yeah, I'm off out today... might just take it easy though as I dont feel 100% for some reason!    How are you?
@BBCWeatherNE_C Urgh, please say you're joking!  Here's me thinking it's looking like a lovely, warm day.  Am I wrong??  
@HayleyNewland It's Sam....   Op on his balls unfortunatley!!
@Hans_Karl Just a great day with the family....  didn't want it to end!!    And you?
@sparkes1 Tell me about it... all i can see is blue sky!  Not fair.... 
@Benniboy22 I was just gonna mention the fuel... very sad day indeed.    #447
@lesley007 Nah, not yet...  just be a few hours till they find what they're looking for.  That plane has been down for some time 
Brazil says debris found in Atlantic is that of Air France flight #447 : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8080290.stm  
@howlertwit Ooops.....    I'm never gonna win, am I ?  lol

@JennaMadison Ooh, coffee!  Great idea...  want one??  
@JennaMadison lol   What are your plans for today (or should I say tomorrow) then ?
@JennaMadison That's ok then....  I accept the slave role...  Your wish is my command...  hahaha

@HayleyNewland He's a good lad is wore Phil...  known each other for 22 years now... seems like 5 minutes!!  haha   You ok Hayley?
@underdog1979 Was gonna say, probably kill ya, serve the sentence and be living on the insurance cash by now.  You are insured right LOL 
@CFJamesAllen Sunday lunch - the BEST lunch of the week in my opinion.... always over-indulge.  I'm allowed on a Sunday, it's the law lol 
Morning all. Just had a Japanese Green tea.  Tasted awful. But apparently good for you.  Not sure if there is any truth in it, but hey ho 
@ncfcog When i was there I walked so much I wore my shoes out!  I was on business, but made time for some pleasure too 
@vesula I think the changes they're making will make a big difference as to how it works at the moment...  I hope anyway!  
@leeboardman You got that bang on!!!  What's your plans for this week then?  You still in 'holiday mode' ??  
@LosingTheLbs Keep up the good work!!  Sounds like you're doing really well.

@HayleyNewland Morning Hayley.... green tea and toast, I would sit outside in the sun, but it aint 'that' warm.... lol 
@PembsDave Thanks for that Dave....  just what I need on a Sunday morning!  Ahhhhhh...  nice!  
@PembsDave I couldn't agree more!  
@TessMorris Nice one...  just fiddle about with it and you can get an excellent balance that will last for the hour.  Stupid API limits!
