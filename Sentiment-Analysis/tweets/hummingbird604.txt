Leaving to meet friends for brunch, but I think right after I'll have to head back home. Not feeling 100% well 
@caparsons I live in a rather small apartment (500 sq ft) so in theory, I should be able to keep it clean. Not really, unfortunately 
@EricaHargreave I know, I'm having the same problem. Though I was telling @raincoaster that I'm afraid Freckles is awake waiting for me 
@raincoaster Are you going home and to bed? What's up?!?! You got through your workload way too fast! 
@WordSpring @TimAyres EEW  Cheese. I hate cheese.
@sanazj I dunno, I have tried it in various forms and nothing, can't really like it  my dislike of cheese is an enigma to me
@tararobertson The three times I've been to Toshi the service has been rude and the food dismal 
I want to cry right about now 
@lynneux Thanks Lynn - I've downloaded it but stupid me, I completely did NOT save the review  I am *this* close to a meltdown
@Yurechko I no longer use Word on my laptop, I use OpenOffice 
@sweetie_pi @greenani Writing academic peer-reviews requires time, concentration and ensuring that you write a solid statement 
@glenmc I downloaded Google Desktop and now they are conflicting 
@kathanley Alas, lunch was had by myself. Which is kind of sad 
@kasiafink My Mom is in Mexico right now. No chance of me getting cake any time soon 
@nickb My blog post on the various ways in which newspapers could adapt to emergence of new media got ZERO comments 
@counti8 NOOOO! I wanted to go there, I actually was thinking of going there last night! 
I was talking about you with JT this morning, Rebecca @miss604 - I mentioned I miss our Friday lunches 
@ColleenCoplick I did, and I replied. TWICE. You're not paying attention to me 
@latincouver It will have to be very brief, sadly. I have 2 research articles to finish 
@lacouvee That's exactly why I am not going  #yyj #yvr
@lacouvee It will be a problem, but I am thinking I might be able to fix it. I'll have to juggle 2 computers, though 
@pfost_7 Ben studied inter-war Japan so I was mentioning to Deb Mc that I was not up on World War I and II history  I am ashamed
@imrananwar @CrunchyCarpets @AspaPhoto @unclespeedo @_lisas Canada was apathetic too, BC too. Mexico is going that route too 
@SparklingAmber Splitz is so close to my house! Too bad I'm heading DT right now  would have loved to see you!
@joshlavoie @n8s8e It is very unfortunately, sadly 
My frustration comes from the fact that well, I'm NOT a depression expert. I'm an environmental politics and policy specialist 
@thenetworkhub Lucky you, Minna - I'm on the other hand, still going 
You know, I always thought Twitter would help me find my next boyfriend. Sadly, social media does not work that way! 
@PonteStudios See, that's the problem! I am a very loving guy, both online and offline. But darn, I think my publicness works against me 
@queerfilmfest Did you check my message re: media accreditation? I sent you guys an email MONTHS ago 
@gillianshaw I didn't get an iphone to try  I should write more about tech on my blog!
Sorry to be missing @counti8's session on mapping  #vcc09 - I hope to learn more in a one-on-one meeting

@StacieBee I'm going to have to start a support group for all of us in Grey's Anatomy withdrawal

@BarryForward Very pleased you enjoyed it  looking forward to seeing you at the next one!
@trevorboudreau I think I saw  you last night at the LOUD awards but our paths didn't actually cross directly 
Since I use PC, I had to use an application not for Mac - I used this -  http://bit.ly/12mDBx - Adolix - freeware 
@Bradinator I agree! 
@GusF I know! I just wish Star Trek's Scotty had already perfected the teleportation device so I could teleport w/you guys 
@moritherapy I'm fine with whatever hashtag you choose  #stuffyteaparty #stuffytweaparty
@ColleenCoplick I much rather go for a walk in plain daylight  rather than at 12.30AM (even though I live in what is considered safe area)
@ColleenCoplick This should be the topic of a tea somewhere along the Main Street neighbourhood 
@CathyBrowne I think @ColleenCoplick has a point in that engaging w/bully was probably not right. But at least I didn't kick his ass 
@AspaPhoto I know! It should be a great day  are you and @pastrudel spending the whole day at the event?
@frodofied Very cool. You should take a day off or something 
@mgmyself Doing great, beautiful, thank you  I do have a lot of work to do, but sort of conflicted as to what to tackle first.
@avidjon Good morning Jon! I was telling @mgmyself and @frodofied that age is, indeed a social construct and a self-perception 
@davemacdonald Thank you!  I am quite excited - after the defense, my committee said I should turn it into a book so I am doing it 
For @kontentcreative who said that they didn't like Phil Collins - Easy Lover by the inimitable PC!  ♫ http://blip.fm/~7f1e0

@davidiangray Thank you! I didn't know where the L'Altro Bucca is 
@luckyfish Well, honey - you ARE hot. No wonder you're melting  xoxoxo
@RussbyStarlite Ah, the glorious life of a puppy 
@chicken_scratch I *might* attend VanChangeCamp, not guaranteed yet 
@GusF Thanks!  what are you and @RussbyStarlite doing tonight?
@marialavis I know! I don't think any of the Gods talk to each other 
@moritherapy Will have cup, lots of english breakfast tea and laptop prepared  #stuffytweaparty
@lacouvee Ah *sigh* I need @hootsuite with @tweetdeck capabilities. NOW. 
@CathyBrowne @shelisrael That's awesome! Slowly but surely I'm reaching out to new awesome big name people on Twitter  which is good!
I know @frodofied loves Tina Turner. I also know he's not gone to bed yet. So I'll send him a &quot;Private Dancer&quot;  ♫ http://blip.fm/~7ha2x
@thenetworkhub Sending that little email we promised 
@PowellRiverBook I'll have to look for that song  #Canada
@atomicpoet Awesome, good times! 
@billyfung Thanks for the #followfriday love! 
@GusF Yes, they are filming an episode of something-something at the Duello School. Sword-play and stuff. It might be my break 
@dinocelotti Thanks so much for the #followfriday Dino! always appreciated

@lynneux Thanks Lynne! Just now? 
Dear @ev &amp; @biz - I know u just came back from 1 hour maintenance, but could @twitter please be slightly reliable 1 hour afterwards? Thx 
@dkkauwe I dislike one-way communication. I don't follow many people but I talk with everyone who follows me and/or talks to me 
@dkkauwe Very much agreed 
@AspaPhoto took some spectacular photos of me where I look pretty damn hot. Greg, where are those? Can I have them, pretty please?

@bombayologist I am looking to manage my PDFs and get the metadata. Help please? 
@krisnelson Ok, will try  thanks!
@WordSpring @lacouvee Thank you for keeping my best interest at heart, you lovely friends 
@CatherineOmega I don't think @kk nor @cognoscento should keep their #beardface but heck, I ain't kissing any of them, so not my problem 
@cognoscento DUDE. You have NO IDEA how many hot women approach me. I'm ALWAYS surrounded by hot women. Haven't noticed? 
OMG. I think @StacieBee @cognoscento @SparklingAmber and @penmachine will recognize this song  Expose's Come ... ♫ http://blip.fm/~7r8h1
@IanAMartin Yes  you did 
@wowie @AspaPhoto @avidjon @moneycoach @ernieyacub @ericbuchegger I have already surpassed G&amp;T # 2  going to # 3 as I type this.
@GusF if you happen to hang out with @chrisheuer give him a big hug on my behalf, will you please? 
@StacieBee Thank you Stacie!  I hope you and @johnbiehler are having a grand time in Penticton. When are you guys back?
@dilarahamid I love it too 
@lacouvee Definitely bright days ahead 
Thanks everyone. Tweeting while needing to process emotions has been so cathartic. Thanks all. And see? No names were mentioned! 
@DrKathleenYoung Hi Kathleen, good morning!  I tweeted something about motivation for a PhD - did you see it? 
@paddlinggeek Hi Kimm!  wow 11 hours of sleep. I am SO envious  how have you been?
@StacieBee I think you rank super mega high on the Awesomesauceness scale 
@frodofied Technically @mgmyself is your comadre. Compadre is reserved for males (i.e. you and I would be compadres) Comadre for females 
@ddmeyer I'd consider enrolling in your class as you're very passionate about teaching. If only it wasn't in California, Dan 
Having attended one of your talks, dearest @nora 3000 and liveblogged, I can assure you - I LOVE your thinking! 
@Atomos I went up the Chief only as a hike 
@CynnamonS I loved Wonder Woman  and I love making people remember about her 
B'stro created the website for @qmunity 
@Qmunity @jjbreakspear Great to see you and very happy to support Qmunity 
@elizapi Me too! I really enjoy our chats  Sometimes I may have a flurry of @ replies and that's why it takes me a while to respond, sorry
