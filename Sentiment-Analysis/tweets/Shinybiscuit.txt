@addersop I went to Creamfields 2 years ago, but it was full of pricks  The crowd at BF are just really friendly and sound.
@AndyRileyish I dunno, but it wasn't cream soda 
@jackfaulkner Oh, jealous. I can only get Iplayer  
I made loads of mistakes typing a comment on @charltonbrooker's column  I look likea  right idiot now. Damn enthusiasm.
@PK_1 I can't read it right now, I'm trying to get ready for Uni, and I'm late 
@cassiusaway In my direction, and from a great height. I'm now covered in pay day poo. 
@mattmaloney I don't stalk people  I &quot;care&quot;.
@mattmaloney  s'ok *shuffles feet*
@DJbruce92 Told myself I wouldn't play til I finished uni work. I had to uninstall it to keep me on track 
@pup218 But....it'd melt. Once I bonded with it I'd need years of therapy to get over the ordeal of finding my baby in a veg puddle 
@gleepface  Work is poop. Still, you've only got a couple of hours left, right?
@jackfaulkner  Get on the smack. Does wonders for your pain.
@jackfaulkner  Only trying to help.
@xthemusic I promise I will  GOODBYE ANT...I WILL NEVA LUV AGEN
Finishing the video. Fuck me, it's so long 
I think I've forgotten to mention some people on my video 
@jackfaulkner I forgot all of those people 
@jackfaulkner Don't have time - got work later 
:O Looking through my old stuff and found a record from my old band! Well,a band that I was in for about a month. Ever heard of  ?
@liamlager Noes has none of that  I wish I did though...I love those crunchy nut clusters.
@liamlager  chin
@gleepface Matt Bellarlly iz a nob 
@camiknickers At least you have a garden. JEALOUS 
@xthemusic  Just do what I'm doing - pretend the exams don't exist for the day and go to the park ^__^
@xthemusic  *small voice* fuck you Ant...
@xthemusic  I hate the indusrty I long to work in.
My favourite model has gone from ASOS.com  Now which clothes do I buy? That was the only way I knew! I hate shopping.
@SoulIsTheGoal  Don't remember. remember the Incredible Games though? Now THAT was CBBC worth watching.
@mattmaloney Soz mate  Was just a joke...but I didn't really know whether you had or not.
@vivmondo I don't wanna rip the Charlster off too much. I'm already morphing into his writing style   Thanks about the non-tool thing!
@dj_lc  I bet! You'll get yours though on your day off!]
 I'm too scared to go on holiday these days:  http://tinyurl.com/lkgtac Nightmare after nightmare of plane crashes. Sadface.
@peteboov  Shame
@AmberGamblerAV    URRRGHHHH KEEP THE PRESENTS If it means polystyrene I don't want any of it 
@alexandergreen PUNTASTIC! haha I can't think of anymore  lol
@camiknickers  It's true. Kill'em all, that's what I say.
@CTerry1985  Sorry
@citra78  I used to be in a chiptune band lol
@mattmaloney  but...nope, sorry. The sentiment is there, but I just can't say it lol
@mattmaloney I dunno, I hate change 
Patrick Wolf's newest album has really disappointed me  I love him usually. Wind in the Wires is one of my most favourite albums. Shame.
I'm afraid that when I put up my blog, I will get loads of abuse from racists 
@StanDevia I don't understand  
@xthemusic ....bonds are made using violence? Surely he'd just be scared of me? Maybe that's the best I can hope for 
@mattmaloney &quot;We're sorry, game play is currently unavailable&quot;  :'(
@camiknickers I didn't think of that. Is that true? It isn't. Oh no.  My poor innocent cake.
@thecraigmorris S'all gone  Waa! Was such a good plan!
I forgot an entire paragraph  I'll write it tomorrow and then remind you all to read it again.
@mtrh Magic bus? mega bus has gone right up in price  Â£20 return? Whuttt?
@xthemusic ...he grabbed some of the chicken (the best bit  ) and threw it to the ground in disgust. And then left.
@thecraigmorris Noes like party ring 
@mattmaloney It looked FUCKING SCARY from where I was sat. I'm such a coward 
@xthemusic Urrrgh *shudders* 
@iamnotsteve  Maybe you could strike up a friendship! Offer him a cup of tea. Do it!
@camiknickers Oh christ, I am such a cunt. I got that for a christmas present 
I don't want a green picture  DOES THIS MAKE ME A TERRORIST?
@Alex_Le_Trend I know, I know, I'm sorry  Had to change it cuz of peer pressure. So I got one with absinthe and a sexy fairy on for you.
@jackfaulkner LOL FAIL (I am working in the evening  )
@mattmaloney  Oh. This has made me sad.
@xthemusic No....it is me and Jack dressing up and putting on pantomimes in episode format.  You caught us out.
@charltonbrooker I already have 67 of those  LAME
@thecraigmorris NO  They were nice well behaved kids with wool for hair. Don't be mean.
@camiknickers Oh no, smelly teacher fail 
@camiknickers  Still, free books though.
@jackfaulkner  but lol at the same time.
@xthemusic Nice idea...but won't the cakes get squished in the post?  (although they'd probably look better that way ha)
@SilkyBanana I just had one...and one turned into loads 
@KrystalSim Uncy Bri-Bri would definitely have a kagoul to lend me  I want my uncy bri-bri.
@xthemusic WHY DON'T YOU SHUT THE H- yeah, that's something I've been considering, actually. Bloody northern weather 
Only just getting my break now. They forgot about me 
@jackfaulkner It was BUSY AS FUCK  I'm still knackered. Still, FIN OV DA MONEYIS
@WWDWD Oh no  I fainted in a clothes shop once when my mum jumped out of a rail of coats. I didn't know she was in town. The shame 
@jackfaulkner Need the money  Anyway, I should have rang before 12 for sickwork, but I was sleeping off the ill, innit. Nevermind.
@xthemusic Yeah, but I think I'm poorly as well as hungover, so it might be acceptable. I bumped my head 
@jackfaulkner I meant it was really hard to tal to people  Mean. I tried to clarify but it all went wrong.
@xthemusic I am hereby giving credit to @peterepeater for showing me that tv show. It is funny and :O  in equal measure.
@mattmaloney  Bad poorly times for the sick crew. We is da illist of da ill.
@Bimbo_Butterkek OMG   I cannnn't I have worrrrk   That looks ace though!

@PK_1 Aw, thanks! 
@SoulIsTheGoal The more the merrier 
@xthemusic  *Double Team Idea* We wear tshirts with our names on. As a cool gimmick. But never refer to ourselves as those names.
@xthemusic Yes...but....Cameron? I'm not doubting your beliefs, I'd just like you to explain please 
@mattmaloney I feel cheered up. Wow, talking works! Tanks! Hope you're happy this morning 
@bobbychariot Welcome. I dropped my phone in orange juice, and it worked after three days in rice and on a sunny windowledge 
@camiknickers Hurray! I like all these special bits specially for me  That Takes the Biscuit: Katie rants for 10 seconds on anything
@thecraigmorris @SoulIsTheGoal @jackfaulkner Nyaww, thanks guys  wish I had remembered to put it in the first time round. Nevermind!
@mtrh Yeah, I was Pissed Off because I was in the middle of a blog, but my computer has pulled through  YAY!
