My cat thinks I have a funny-looking face...  
My ghost punched me and gave me a boo-boo... 
@shaunduke Oh yeah...I forgot I looked like this... 
@brianjshoopman Me try to take ride on bus stop, like people say, but bench not move. 
@brianjshoopman That sad. Sometimes I see flying tractors in sky, and wonder why they harvest cloud. Cotton candy? Me can't figure out. 
@brianjshoopman Maybe golf balls poke holes in clouds and make rain fall down.  Then I get too wet, because my umbrella inside out. 
I'm training my yard gnomes in the deadly art of spork fu, but they keep poking me in the eye... 
@brianjshoopman Yeah!  Tractor golfers need learn better manners. 
Can anyone tell me how to get to Sesame Street?  I went over the rainbow, through the woods...now I'm lost... 
I'm afraid of traffic cones.  I don't like driving near them.  They freak me out. 
My tum hurts.  I think I ate too many anthropomorphic vegetables... 
@Danebarrel Yeah--duck prejudice is a big problem among the primates. 
The bananas made pajamas out of dried human skin flakes they collected... 
@mopedronin Yeah--me too.  I do like the taste of tarantula more, but I don't like the way their spirits haunt my dreams.  
@TexicanRadio Yes.  That's what happened to me, I'm afraid.  I already have a big red rotting zombie clown nose. 
@Larkn0298 Sorry about that!  I responded before, but for some reason the message didn't get through. 
Dang--I just checked my sent DMs...and a lot of the messages I wrote yesterday never went through... 
The evil clowns who live in my attic are trying to make me laugh by tickling my neck with their overgrown nose hairs, but it's not funny. 
My computer just sneezed.  Is that bad?  
@AWDawno Yeah--think he has a virus. 
@emmacharlesbeth Sorry about the sunburn. 
@_Mr_Blonde Hear hear.  I hate that. 
@_Mr_Blonde I've tried zombie hordes and evil clowns.  No luck yet.  Maybe a program of some sort? 
I think it's sad that Count Chocula drinks the blood of chocolate bunnies. 
@onezumi Yeah--they're not very nice. 
@MissKitty1923 He probably will bite my other elbow. 
@chunky666 Aw--sorry about that. 
@stephenfry Using your name like that---that's not right. 
@NancyHightower Sorry, Nancy. 
@psychomule Awesome--thanks for the interest!  When the time comes, hope you enjoy the read.

@JennaIsWriting Yeah--he's cool!  I like him and Desmond (though he hasn't done much this season). 
@littlefluffycat hehe--sorry.  I've never been very good at blending in... 
@rorschachsgirl Yeah--those pants are horrible!  Yeah--my wife loves the job.  She loves performing and kids, so it's a good environment. 
Off to the Dream World to battle the evil Spork Horde.  Later, folks. 
@Merc_hyn_di Thanks! 
Thanks to everyone who left a comment on the &quot;Camp&quot; page of Pseudopod.  That sort of feedback fills my soul with chocolaty goodness.

@rainyz Thanks for protecting me from @jimmyfallon! 
@brianjshoopman Phew--dishes finally finished.  I ended up discussing philosophy with them, so it took a while.

@coconutmonkeys Coconut Monkeys do rule the universe. 
@Jan_Geronimo Yeah--not very delicious, but I was desperate. 
@brianjshoopman That's just like me.

Working on a children's chapter book.  I love these characters. 
@kaolinfire Yeah--definitely!  Love The Witches.  
@trreed That's alright.  As long as they don't try to kiss me. 
@Ellsea The harder the better, I always say. 
@LostMarilyn Here's a cute one for you: http://tinyurl.com/p3gfgh 
@LostMarilyn Sounds like a fun place, with all the gnomes and anteaters. 
@PomegranPenguin Excellent!  Most balloon animals are evil anyway... 
@sgsuperone Awesome!  I think the second time brought the clown back, but the third time sent him packing again. 
@trreed Thanks for your help in ridding the world of the evil clown menace! 
@BaronessHeather No worries, Heather!  Take all the time you need. 
@slasherbernie No plans to go to comic-con at this point, I'm afraid.  Would love to go though. 
Played some fun improv games for hours with my wife, brothers, and my brother's boyfriend.  A wonderfully insane time was had by all.
