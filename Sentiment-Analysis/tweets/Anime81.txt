@NinjaFanpire I'm blipping...drinking...people are still here... :laughs: I'm hungry... 
@NinjaFanpire That you performed that song with him TWICE. Is it the right person I'm thinking of? :laughs: Sorry, it's almost 4am. 
@NinjaFanpire I think you're right. :laughs: I really wanted the Elphaba snow globe though...It looked so badass... but cost $75 
@SasaLoves That sucks buttocks... 
@MoREthANHuMAn :laughs: This is true...I'll always have a job, I guess. :grins: But yes, it totally and completely sucks buttocks.

@WerewolfEmbry :giggles: I think my Asian genes are getting in the way of my Native American genes and are refusing to let me grow taller 
@WerewolfEmbry :sighs: I cannot help that I am little. :rolls eyes: Unfair, really. I've seen some tall Native American girls. 
@WerewolfEmbry :pouty face: You hurted me... 
@SassySenna :texts: Yes, he did! And he didn't even notice until @RebeccaBlack_ said something about it!

@WerewolfSam :holds up hands: I had *nothing* to do with it Sam! I was trying to get him cleaned up! :looks at @WerewolfEmbry: Tell him! 
@WerewolfEmbry That's not good...you should go and get that taken care of. Like IRL... seriously...that shit's no joke. 
@WerewolfEmbry :hugs you back carefully: Still hurts much?
