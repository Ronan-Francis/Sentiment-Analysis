Eating half of a gala apple.  The other half goes to @vansunder.  The batch that I picked out this time are all bruised.  Bad picking!  
@mayorsam Sorry to hear that.   Well luckily there is always more fish in the sea.
@filzen That is understandable. I am so sorry to hear about your dog. 
@mbl4889 That is great! Definitely harder while on the road, but not impossible.  Takes pre-planning and making good choices. 
Time for breakfast and tea! White tea! 
Time to warm up my oatmeal! 
Getting ready to do some more video recording for Being Healthy TV.  
@MyPreciousKid So true, lots of work gets done during naps and at night! 
@PHILIPGRANGER Good morning! 
Finished the delicious breakfast/brunch.  My son is getting tired.  Almost time for his nap. 
@nikzaz LOL! Hopefully, your ship comes in soon. 
@FishFry Wow, you had quite a fancy breakfast this morning!  I just had oatmeal with blueberries.  
Lunch is done and my son is taking his nap.  Time to get to work on content for my next show. 
@steelhoof Too much work to do, need to do more work tonight. 
@SmartWoman Sounds great! Definitely a grand party next year! 
@TrueLemon That is good! 
@Dasit Thanks for the retweet! Have a nice evening! 
@stephanewws Thanks for finding me!  Have a wonderful evening! 
@DarryleP I just have one, he is 14 months. I don't think he realizes that it is Mother's Day tomorrow. LOL! 
@DarryleP I guess that's true! 
@vansunder is making me hot chocolate with almond milk.  Mother Day festivities is starting early! 
@DarryleP LOL! I do splurge on chocolate now and then.  And I plan on splurging a little tomorrow! 
@journik LOL!  That is just the way I was brought up.  
@memoriesalive They are! Love mine! She is a wonderful, kind woman who is a good cook!

@adbert Good morning or afternoon! How are you Adrian? 
Done with lunch and my mother-in-law is washing the dishes! That is right this time I don't have too! Yay, for nice mother-in-laws! 
@PilatesGirl_BB Thanks! You have a nice rest of the day too! 
@JeffAshcroft No, I don't.  But maybe one day I will take it up. 
Late dinner, which means late dish washing session.  Oh well, the dinner was worth the washing! 
@freehrm Cheers! What are you having? 
I guess I needed the sleep. 
Making an early lunch today! Time to make salad. 
.@StephMorrison I never really got barbies.  Just got legos when I was a kid.  Grew up playing with legos. 
Finished the aerobic part of my workout! Time for weight lifting and core/abdominal exercises.  
Finished working out.  Feeling great!  Going to take a shower and then get to work on my next blog post. 
@disability Hi Rudy! Hope your day is going well. Thanks for the retweet! 
@erkpod LOL! I thought so! Have fun in Vegas. 
When @vansunder is done recording Millionaire or Bust, we plan on shooting some more video for the promo for Being Healthy TV.

@ComfyPaws I will definitely look into that.  Thanks! 
Going to have a cup of tea and then it is off to bed for me.  Good night everyone! Tweet you later! 
Well, I didn't get my 9 hours of sleep.  My son woke me up before that.  But at least I got 8 hours. Still good! 
.@almostcool Yes, I love making pancakes with blueberries! Yummy to my tummy! 
Warming up some water for Darjeeling tea! 
@vansunder is up! Time to make the pancakes! 
@denvercheetoh It must be a very fulfilling job!  It looks like you enjoy it tremendously! 
.@steveofmaine You can have your favorite foods occasionally, just not a good idea to have it all the time. Hope that helped. 
@denvercheetoh You too! 
Now time for my breakfast. 
@Mark_Salinas Good morning Mark! How are you? Haven't talked to you in a while. 
@Mark_Salinas Glad to see you back!
