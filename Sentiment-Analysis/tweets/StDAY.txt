@xoMusicLoverxo You're all ganging up on me. 
I should actually go to sleep. I need to get up early tomorrow to do actual work since I have an assignment due &amp; an exam Monday. Fail. 
Have an exam tomorrow. Have I studied at all? No. Fail. Have a response and a thesis due tomorrow. Have I done the reading? No. Fail. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Awww! That means...oh, I can't even say it. I'll start crying. 
Ew. Stupid mobile web twitter.  ANYWAY, I realized my coworkers are still working. Poor them.
Finally home. Collapsed on the couch. I'm feeling sick though. Last part of drive I felt queasy and like I was gonna puke. 
@eeshkapeesh  sorry. Was trying to type on this stupid phone and it messed up. Fail.
@eeshkapeesh sorry you feel that way. 
@eeshkapeesh oh. :/ well... Crap. My sympathetic ear is lame again. 
Why is so freakin' hot right now?! It's almost 11, it's not supposed to be near 70 degrees! 
@xoMusicLoverxo I didn't even notice that. Pasta building! 
@xoMusicLoverxo and I ruined it already. Forgot the last a in pasta. Fail. 
@eeshkapeesh YES! I was eating and then it started playing and I was like, WHAT?! EW! 
How is it that I still have 2 hours plus till I get off of work?!  3997.
@xoMusicLoverxo ...I was in the middle of S&amp;R and it wasn't developed fully. Now it's been half a year since I updated it. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Haha. Yeah I KNOW I need to update. I feel so guilty for lagging. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Mobile twitter does suck. I hate it.  But it'll have to do for the moment...
@xoMusicLoverxo EXACTLY!  I can't wait till fall either. Evil show.  I got chills with the George thing though. Yup. 007. 
Oh no! The pit of despair! 
Waking up any time before 8 is AWESOME! Right?? Right?? WRONG! 
Aww, man! I bought a notebook that doesn't have perforated pages. I hate that. 
@commensense It is! I really liked it! But I can't wait for the FALL for the rest of the episodes! 
I. Want. To. Go. Home. Now. 
@a_simple_girl Goodnight, love! *hug* Okay! Ice ice baby! oh, that was BAD. Sorry. 
Seriously, I had to restart it about 7 times. Stupid phone. 
Anyway, I'm REALLY not looking forward to work. Plus, my ankle is being all stupid.  I thought it was better! Now I'm limping more... 
He changed it to the Top 40/pop station. From the GOOD rock station. Why?? I want to hit him. 
Well, it might be a combo of my twitter frustrations and sheet BOREDOM at work. Blegh. 
Sheet? I meant sheer. Damn typo. 
Seriously? Love you top? I meant TOO! Damn typos AGAIN. 
I want to go HOME. I'm sick of working with these guys. 
I don't wanna get out of bed... Do I have to? Yes? Fiiiiiine... 
My head hurts. Badly. 
Awake. Haven't actually gone to sleep. Damn insomnia. 
It's 3 freaking 20 am. 
@a_simple_girl Glad someone appreciates my humor. *hugs* and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be limping again today. Darn foot!  Love you too!
@Solzah Same here, same here. :/ I have to write a 10pg paper tomorrow. Very stressed about it.  But how are you?
Aw hell. Just passed by a pizza place. Now I want pizza. 
Okay. Break over. Back to work. Ewwww. 
@xoMusicLoverxo I'm really sad now. Sounds like an awesome show. 
2 more hours. Blah blah blah. :/ Radio switched to the rap. 
My boss took my position at the register. Now I have to limp around. Pooface. 
And I think the flash drive is lost forever. Dammit. 
@a_simple_girl Okay...well...FINE!  No seriously. I'm on it. Bye.
Crap. I suck. I'm nowhere and I mean NOWHERE near done. Shoot.  I hate this stupid paper.
@xoMusicLoverxo He's a bastard.  He said no. I seriously wish I had more time. 
@xoMusicLoverxo He freaking deserves it though. Dumb old man. Not letting me have more time so that I can finish this friggin' paper. 
I'm Sorry, Mary - Matt Wertz. Seriously? THAT song is gonna play now? Grrrrr... 
Ugh. Not going to sleep anytime soon. It's 1:45am. 11 hours till the deadline. Damn. 
It's cooooold.  I want to curl up in my blankets SOOO bad. Stinkin' 57 degree weather. Stinkin' paper. Stinkin' friggin' college.
I've been losing cell service quite frequently this morning. Not cool. Is it cause of the rain? I dunno but I don't like it. 
Wooing? Seriously? I MEANT WORKING. Fail. 
@xoMusicLoverxo oh crap. I didn't notice that. Triple fail. Sorry. 
@a_simple_girl Awww.  Read my story about the hobo and the monkey. Maybe it'll make you feel better. *hugs* Dont be sad! 
I'm really tired.  I want to go home. Only an hour and a half left thankfully.
Ow. Just accidentally sat on my ankle and it hurts. 
@xoMusicLoverxo You were teasing me! Hurt my feelings. 
@eeshkapeesh Honey, no matter what, the overwhelming FAIL can't be forgotten. Sorry. 
@xoMusicLoverxo You're just being mean now.  How am I supposed to write when you're being mean to me!
@eeshkapeesh STOP. DRIVE. NO TWEETS THAT ENDANGER YOUR BEING! 
@a_simple_girl Thanks, love. I've been dying to see it. Stupid technological difficulties... 
@a_simple_girl I can't hear anything...  But it LOOKS cute...
@a_simple_girl Again??? Damn. It keeps happening to me too! I hate it. 
@a_simple_girl Dammit. I just checked and it hit me again! Ewwwww. 
@xoMusicLoverxo It's a plan. Cause that's just nasty. 
Ew. I've still got an hour left. Blegh. 
Crap. I think I'm getting cramps. Boo. 
Ew. I'm gonna close tonight, get home near 1am, sleep around 2, THEN have to get up EARLY to open tomorrow. Poo. 
What I MEANT to do was something clever using the lyrics from This Town but it FAILED by sending before I was done. 
But my boss was on the register so I didn't get to speak with him again. 
I switched my morning shift tomorrow for Wednesday. AWESOME. Now I can SLEEP after tonight. 
Blegh. I've got an hour and a half left. Boo. 
@xoMusicLoverxo you should sleep... It's GOOD to sleep. I wish I could go home... But I still have like an HOUR of NOTHING. 
How come everyone is going to sleep and I'm still stuck here?!? No fair!! 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! I didn't pass one of my classes...  The one with the DAMNED PAPERS. 
I'm not gonna let this class mess me up or bum me out. I'll get over it. It just SUCKS that I KILLED myself for a class I didn't pass. 
Damn. I have a HORRIBLE GPA. I just noticed. Gosh, I FAIL.  I really need to improve next year... 
I really hate it when people talk about me either, when I'm not in the room or as if I'm not there. It's freaking rude. 
And even though the weather thing on my phone says it's 59 degrees, I think it LIES. I'm kicking off my covers. It's stuffy and hot. 
Yeah...I don't know if I'm going back to sleep... This ain't cool.  I only slept like 4 hours. 
Ow. I got a muscle cramp in my shoulder. Owwwww. 
So my initial alarm was for 27 minutes ago. My second one is for 20 minutes from now. I don't like being awake for both. 
I might take a short little nap right now... Like half an hour... My head hurts from not sleeping... 
The nightly news is depressing.  Car crashes, suicides, and now I hear sirens from my window. What's up with the world? 
Everyone's turning their avatar green! I dont know if I can change mine on my phone and I don't have access to a computer! 
What the hell! I can't switch it back now!  This sucks! I'm stuck with these nasty bright green until I get back on a computer. 
 This ain't cool... Maybe I can get on the computer before I go to sleep... Hopefully...
@eeshkapeesh The whole green thing messed up my pic. 
Seriously I NEED to clean. This place is a sty. Why can't I focus??  If I don't clean NOW I won't be able to write soon. 
Ugh. Just got my schedule for next week. I'm working the weekend again. Why? I told him I'd rather work weekdays and NOT on Sundays 
@eeshkapeesh Awww.  That sucks. I hate when that happens. (nearly every night for me)
@eeshkapeesh I KNOW! I hate it too! It messes up and makes my typing confusing! 
I guess that's a no on A Cinderella Story...  Especially since my DVD player is on the fritz too. What's up with technology FAILING today?
Ugh. I really do think I'm getting sick. Not cool.  I hate coughs.
I am Sam!!!! Awwww! I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Oh no. Can't watch it. I'll cry. 
Oh my god, I forgot they were gonna give King Arthur today! I missed it! I haven't seen that in FOREVER! 
PLEASE tell me I'll be able to get back to sleep. Because I've already been up for longer than I want. Why am even awake??? It's 5:47am!! 
At work. Yay. My throat still feels weird. Ugh. I don't want to get sick. 
Told her I went to sleep at 2, woke up at 5:30 and &quot;slept&quot; till 9 but it was more like drifting in and out and actual sleep.  Ugh.
My coworker is telling me about stuff going on with her husband. I don't want to seem rude but I REALLY don't care! 
Great. The first customer was this snot-nosed teenage boy who put me in a worse mood. Ugh. 
@a_simple_girl super. (sarcasm). I'm annoyed, tired from 3 hrs of sleep, working and my throat hurts.  but how are you sweetie?
Ugggggh! This thing is so SLOW. 
DAMMIT! AHHH! This aint cool. I'm so MAD. WHAT THE HELL!! 
All my music was erased and while I was adding them again, the computer messed up. 
I hate computer problems. Ugh. A horrid end to a REALLY CRAPPY day. 
Saturday SUCKED. And now I only have 700 songs on my phone. What?!  Gonna try to sleep.
I had planned on straightening my hair. But then the computer DIED so I didn't straighten it. 
@xoMusicLoverxo OH BOY, is it a long story. 
Seriously? All my ringtones are gone? Ugh. So not cool. 
I'm falling asleep on the counter. Literally. Resting my head on my arms and pretty close to sleeping. It's so BORIIIING. 
Ewww... Answered the phone at work and there was this nasty green liquid-y stuff on the bottom. Gross! 
Okay. I'm awake. Woo. Got 6 hours of sleep. Not HORRIBLE. But I'm feeling like crap.  I WAS planning on going out to breakfast...
@a_simple_girl Sorry hon! *hugs and cradles in arms* I'm at work so...I'm working... 
I'm BORED. It's been BEYOND slow and I still have 4 hours. 
Tomorrow/today is my free/lazy day. I'm so happy.  I'm gonna SLEEP like nobody's business and maybe actually WRITE something. 
@andydavis Aw! Sounds like you need a hug... Um, that came out creepier than I'd planned. Sorry for the loneliness! Sleep well! 
FINALLY home. Gotta do some schoolwork. But since it's still early-ish, there's hope for some writing later on. 
I rang up a girl's purchase today at work and she used a Cardinals themed credit card. Guess who I was reminded of? Haha. 
Yup. Definitely not. &quot;You Can Never Go Back&quot; - Jon McLaughlin. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Honestly, it was the first thing I thought of when I read the sign.  Blue! You're my boy!
@xoMusicLoverxo if I was talking to you, I'd tell you good night.  Haha. Night, J. 
@eeshkapeesh I bet. :/ But it's over! 
@xoMusicLoverxo  and that means... Haha. 
@xoMusicLoverxo oh, I know. I wouldn't think you'd lie about that.  thanks again. 
The Story - Brandi Carlile. Whoa. This is the song I wrote my first story to. Seems so long ago... Love this song.  So beautiful.
@eeshkapeesh I was about to say there's no way in hell to crack an &quot;eblow&quot; but elbows? I don't know...I manage it. Haha. 
Cows!!  Haha. So many hills, so many cows. 
@xoMusicLoverxo yeppers. They do. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Yup! Total honesty! And it'll be long and rambling as all my reviews are. Forewarning. 
@Solzah oh, it has nothing to do with how long the tweets are (though that is bothersome) it's another type of limit. But thanks anyway! 
@xoMusicLoverxo No worries, I will. First chapter done! Woo! Haha. 
@eeshkapeesh Aw, sorry E. :/ I hope it looks up for you (lame ear) And there's always next year! Crap. Lamer ear :/ Fail. Uhh..Love ya E! 
@eeshkapeesh haha. Okay.  have fun with that. Haha.
@xoMusicLoverxo I'm using it in a story. I actually already wrote it but have to write the chapters before it. 
Goodnight twitterworld. I'll tweet y'all later.  Goodnight, J. 
@eeshkapeesh Haha. I don't even know. But like I said I'm planning on applying for another job. I'll tell you about that later. 
Oh. It's a Green Day special tonight on this radio station. That's awesome. They're gonna play songs off the new album. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Yay! Oh my god, you totally just made me happy.  A seemingly impossible thing while I'm at work. 
Yeah...I'm going to sleep. Yup. It's 2 in the morning. I'm beat. Goodnight, twitterville. 
Awesome song playing as I go to sleep.  Down Goes Another One - McFly 
Awww! They're giving 2 of my favorite movies on TV!! The Princess Bride and Ever After 
@eeshkapeesh I'd watch it. That is one of my FAVORITE movies. LOVE.  But, you could sleep too...
&quot;What is South Hampshire?&quot; Ha. 
Watching Green Day on SNL.  Awesome. Yup.
@xoMusicLoverxo I guess sleep can't wait for you... Goodnight, J.  I might sleep soon as well. Maybe. Or write. Maybe.
Wow. Lied again. I'm watching Waiting... instead of sleeping. Justin Long. Ryan Reynolds. LOVE. 
Actually, scratch that. I'm too tired to stay up watching it. 'Night for real this time. 
Going to sleep. Pretty exhausted. Wish I didn't have school in the morning. But I do. Goodnight, twitsville. 
I think that's all for now... Goodnight for real, twitterland!! 
@Melisie Hi, random reply, but FYI, I think that's an AWESOME idea. Someone should get on top of that!  #stargirlinspace
@Melisie Exactly! All it would take is one tweet from any of the guys. Well, hopefully it happens. I'd love it if they came to the states 
Conan Monday. Conan Monday. CONAN MONDAY! 
@xoMusicLoverxo  Yay with me! 
Folding laundry. And I don't even mind it. THAT'S how happy I am. Haha. 
Oh well. Probably a wrong number. Hopefully. Whatever. They could call back if they want. Haha. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Hahahaha. That's okay. It's the thought that counts. 
@a_simple_girl *takes a bow and snatches back those dollar bills* Thanks, dear.  At least SOMEONE should have fun tonight. 
@a_simple_girl *grin* Thank you, dear. You're making me happy. 
@a_simple_girl That was weird... Haha. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Seriously! Haha. I actually have so many songs that would be perfect. But I'll save those for later... Hahaha. 
The restaurant I went to started playing &quot;I Want to Break Free&quot; and I almost squealed.  But twitter was being stupid so I had to wait.
I've been home for less than five minutes and I'm already in my pajamas and in bed. I LOVE MY BED. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Hmmm...well, I'll try to come up with some for that specifically... 
@eeshkapeesh Haha. I think I got around 570 for my chem one so no worries. Haha. 
@a_simple_girl I'm watching Dead Like Me. Ever watch it? I've only seen a couple eps. Your love Gavin was in one! Thought you'd love that 
@a_simple_girl *catches pizza frisbee/frisbzza?/pizzbee? and chomps down* Thanks dear!! 
@a_simple_girl Go to sleep! Wait... That was a &quot;loud&quot; tweet. *whispers* go to sleeeeeep. 
Adam's Song - Blink-182. I haven't listened to this in AGES! Love it. 
I won the radio battle.  Well, for now... Doin' Time - Sublime  I love Sublime. Yup.
@xoMusicLoverxo Yay indeed!  [FYI, I keep doing this .) smiley instead...]
@xoMusicLoverxo Goodnight, J. Sweet dreams. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Goodnight, J. Thanks. I'll need it. Sweet dreams. 
Okay. Tiny fib. I'm not exactly done. I mean, the paper is written but I have to add the footnotes. Whatever. The PAPER itself is DONE. 
@a_simple_girl Hahahahaha. I LOVED THAT.  Even though I should be mad at you if you did... I wanted the rain... But I still love you!! 
HOME!  I have go work in 4 hours so I'm gonna relax before cleaning a bit.
@a_simple_girl Camping! We can build a fire, tell scary stories, braid our hair, and sing kumbaya! Yay! *bounces up and down* 
DONE.  Going home and going to SLEEP. I open tomorrow morning.
HOME! Going to bed. I'm TIRED. I've got to go back to work again in 10 hours. I need sleep. Goodnight, tweeters. 
@eeshkapeesh True! Haha. What did you get? 
Blow Away - @AFineFrenzy. It's on the radio again. Making this last hour of work pretty awesome. 
Listening to Tyrone Wells and am so excited I'll get to see him live this summer. 
Shoplifter - Green Day 
Watch this video. Little girl singing and dancing to Tyrone Wells (@tyronewells). Adorable!  http://bit.ly/ZmnEe
@xoMusicLoverxo I signed up sophomore year and barely used it. I'm probably just gonna delete it since I dont even care about it. Haha. 
@a_simple_girl Thanks. Did you watch the one I linked to you? PLEASE do. Its so cute. 
@a_simple_girl YOUR SON IS THE BEST KID EVER!!!  I knew there was a reason he's Emperor of the clubhouse!  GENIUS! 
This list of movies is fun.  So far only 76 but I'm not close to being done. 
@a_simple_girl I'm making a list for a friend who hasnt seen A LOT of movies. Great movies. Casablanca, etc. It's a long list. 
Home Alone 2!!!  it's on tv. LOVE!
Okay. If you get hit with a brick to the head from atop a roof, you'd die. But this movie is hilarious. 
Can't forget to add Rocky Horror Picture Show to the list! 
Fresh Prince is on TV! 
@xoMusicLoverxo I believe it. I KNOW I'm missing some... Oh well. Ours probably overlap at most points. She'll need both lists. Haha 
@xoMusicLoverxo So once i finish ill send it to both of you 
@xoMusicLoverxo Not rufulicious, though. It's rufus, not a stick of gum. 
HOME! And it took me a full 2 seconds to get changed into my pjs and into bed. I LOVE MY BED. 
I'm eating a salad. Seriously, WHAT is with this health kick I've been on recently? It's a friggin' awesome salad though. 
The nice, GORGEOUS guy from a couple days ago came back today. 
@xoMusicLoverxo Thanks, J. I hope so too. Sweet dreams. 
Going HOME. FINALLY!!! 
Okay, I'm going to sleep and it will be the sleep of champions! (we are the champions, my friend...) Goodnight, y'all
