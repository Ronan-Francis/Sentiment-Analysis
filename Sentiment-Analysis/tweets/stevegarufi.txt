@taklandrock Ahhhh Chipotle! The nearest Chipotle is the one in downtown CS... 102 miles away from me. 
@evliving Awwww that sounds amazing! In Buena Vista, CO, our high for the entire year in '08 was 86 degrees.  I love hot weather!
@jessgirl I still feel like crap. The fever is alive and well. 
@michelleflores Michelle, I slept for 11 hours last night. I'm still stick with this fever. 
@joycecherrier Awww. Don't mean to sound like an overgrown age 37 baby, but I'm still stick. Not as bad as yesterday, but still bad. 
@ShellyKramer I've had a fever for the past 48 hours. You should see me. I'm unshaven, puffy face and look pathetic! 
@AboutLittleRock Wow. @mhenslee is constantly ranting about his love for Genghis Grill too. Never been there; not here in Colorado. 
@caroldn I feel like a piece of garbage!  See: http://bbltwt.com/nqgp3
@caroldn Okay, no more driving.  I know... I know... you are correct to say that.
@Zo_E Not appealing? Ohhhhh are you still recovering from last night? Awwww. 
@JesCoolbaugh I hear ya. That's why I'm selling Elma in the first place. 
@Ozark_sky Awwww. Yes I just prayed for him. 
@jessgirl I am so sorry Jess. Does laying down aggravate it? Is it affecting your sleep? 
@Zo_E Hi Zoe Hi @callme_goddess. It's early - still have &quot;eye snot&quot; in my eyes this morning.  How are you?
@PSDougles I really need to hike in Colorado National Monument. So many trails, so little time. 
@joycecherrier Fish oils are smelly though, aren't they? 
@Cortnee4Christ Oh I don't think I'm awesome. I'm laying on the couch like a big lazy blob. I'm going to bed by 8:30 p.m. too. 
@Cortnee4Christ I didn't even take a shower today!!! 
@michelleflores Michelle, I gotta wake up. Good grief, I'm lagging.  I still have that icky &quot;eye snot&quot; in my eyes too. 
@greatcorbinski Noooooooo. Don't cut your hair. C'mon! 
@tishac Tisha, would you believe it if I told you I have not experienced 90+ degrees is nearly *FOUR YEARS?* 
@Hetty4Christ I am SO JEALOUS you are @philladden are meeting an amazing summer Arizona tweet-up ... among the saguaros!!! 
@Hetty4Christ I'm the one who's humbled. I wish I lived in Arizona! Oh well, God has me here in Colorado among the snowy trails. 
@Hetty4Christ Where did they move to? Awwww I'm sure they miss the saguaros! 
This is the last weekend for skiing in Colorado for the 2008-09 season. http://tinyurl.com/o64d3a 
@Hetty4Christ That motto begs the question: Why in the world do I live here?! 
@CallMe_Goddess I'm going to bed soon and I shouldn't have eaten that chicken. I'm getting fat in the stomach area. 
@FloridaSunSales I am so jealous! We haven't reached 80 degrees for one single day just yet. It sucks! 
@Zo_E If the sign is for you is to marry him... DON'T DO IT! You don't know him long enough yet. Don't do it! Just sayin'. 
@michelleflores She spoke a lot of Spanish... I didn't understand her.  But she seems really nice. I pursued friends w/ her on FB.
@michelleflores Good night Michelle! 
@kaydeabc http://twitpic.com/3kulk - Sunset photos from airplanes are in a category all to themselves. Good shot! 
@Cortnee4Christ Holy Goats Milk Cortnee! I think about two days ago you had 300 followers, and now you have 500. Yeeesh! 
@JulieAbel The owner of @poppys_pizza in Estes is on Twitter. Just a recommendation. Have fun! 
@Cortnee4Christ I do Cortnee. &quot;Oh my goodness... that's crazy!&quot; 
@faithbookjesus And what's your blog entry about? 
@Pamela_Edwards Heh heh. Odd but amusing. Thanks! 
@Cortnee4Christ Made so many new friends on Twitter around USA. Another bike across USA trip would be amazing to see people! 
@hllyrkt8 You need to own a race horse - call it something like &quot;Girl On The Go&quot; if it's a filly. 
@hllyrkt8 Wine. Tell you what, if I'm like this tomorrow, I will do that. 
@betterinpink By the way, if you make any web sites or images in pink, I'd like to see them. So cool how you like pink! 
@Cortnee4Christ It's like the old myspace days. You gotta go to a specific person's page, and comment to them that way. 
@Zo_E That's not a bad sunset, Zoe! 
@JesCoolbaugh Dots sound wonderful. And yes, it was a sunset sunset all right! 
@opensrcsociety The &quot;TransAm&quot; bike route? Are you biking across America? If so, way to go buddy! Go! Go! Go! 
@Bettaboo Right on. You really ought to visit Arkansas - NW section has lots of hills and pretty towns! 
@Nick7782 @rebeccao372 @gaylegresham @sherrycarter @cherylrmonaghan Thanks friends. As you can see, I'm spoiled by these mountain views. 
@rebeccao372 Awww I would be honored to follow your British friends! 
@evliving I figured you were poking fun. I'm all about fun! 
@evliving Oh wow, you're in Phoenix. How hot is it today? 
@wennie_s You are my hero!!! THANK YOU! 
@jordan1507 Awww thank you Angela! 
@MrNetty Thanks for the photo. I gotta get back w/ photographing the sunsets! 
@hermantile If you drive from Cottonwood Pass into BV, you'll pass my house. Too bad I'll be working during the day. Call anyway. 
@coachkiki In space? Did you just call me a SPACE CADET? Hmmmm. What am I going to do with you Kiki? :p) (Just being goofy here.) 
@coachkiki Thank you Kiki. I'm okay. Facing my fear and going rafting down a river for 1st time in life today. You are my coach! 
ARKANSAS Wooo Pig Sooouie!  @brandonacox @ang0823 (tweets Little Rck pics)  @delaneygates @cruiselaw (grew up in El Dorado!) #followfriday
@ShellyKramer I'm all for @mclinklove attending, but I must request that you bring A BUNCH of your cute female friends! 
Sometimes I feel bad on Fridays. I have *SO MANY* good people to recommend, and it's hard to keep them organized. It's a good problem. 
@MealPlanningMom I'm following all three of them b/c of your recommendation. Still amazed you're sisters with @michelleflores! 
@JJNextGenTV I've appreciated our connection and I trust you've stayed updated with www.MtPrinceton.org? How are you? 
@aimee248 2.5 hour drive from Boulder. 
@Zo_E The Great Sand Dunes sure is pretty, isn't it? 
@geminiriver Becky, good to meet you. Where exactly did you live in Colorado? 
@TellurideLisa I don't get outside much. I'm in a cozy office with dogs answering phones - booking people's raft trips. It's okay. 
@gstarene Yes sir. Correct. Come on... want to go rafting in Buena Vista? 
I've got ((( Mountain Fever ))) tonight. I'm blasting &quot;Find Me Baby&quot; by Moby for some inspiration: http://blip.fm/~5tvnc 
@caroldn Maybe. I think it was the rest. I still need to be careful, but the worst is definitely over. How are you tonight? 
@AspenSpin Forgot to reply to you awhile back. Good to meet you. I get to Aspen every now and then when the pass is open! 
@TammyBurnell I grew up in NJ. (Shhhh!) So where did you live in CO? I'm in teeny tiny Buena Vista. Lots of mountains here. 
@HeatherHAL Awww Heather, yes dear, I am stuck following you. It's a &quot;good stuck&quot; to be stuck following you! 
@TammyBurnell Friday as in TGIF? No I don't think so. I visited the Chipotle on Garden of the Gods Road about 4-5x per week though! 
@Tara_Bear Tara, take a picture of it and tweet it. C'mon! 
@TammyBurnell LOL See, I'm sensitive about this. I am *from* New Jersey, but I've un-New Jerseyified myself completely in past 15 years. 
@joycecherrier Thanks Joyce. It's the region I live in. 
@geminiriver I got a lot done. I anticipate reaching my goal tomorrow. 
@cospringer You gotta love the snow in Colorado, Laura. Leadville is way up at 10K ft - they get a lot. How are you this morning? 
@YourWebChick Starbucks? What's your favorite drink? I gotta tell you... I'm more of a Dunkin Donuts man. 
@DeniseHammock Answer my question: Would you eat one if you were here? 
@krustifer Good luck with anything that helps! 
@threewinks I built a small web site www.ArchesUtah.com to give me an excuse to move there. Who knows? All in God's hands. 
@MistiPearl Oh c'mon... it's fun. You can take out all your rage against boys in that game! 
@coyotecolorado Some of their popular songs are far overplayed on the radio, but I love the deeper cuts. 
@TellurideLisa That's awesome. Take pics? I probably will be encountering snow tomorrow on my hike. 
@TellurideLisa Gotta love the snow. Jay's sister is helping me edit by the way. 
@JesCoolbaugh C'mon, you would look fantastic in that Cadillac. 
@Dropsofreign I'm sorry, but my lips have been neglected 4 *FAR TOO LONG!* I'm moving on Ms. Drops of Reign. I'm chasing cute waitresses! 
@kmcooley Honey if you &quot;hop your happy tail to Colorado,&quot; I would be so happy that I would faint. Then u could tweet a pic of me fainted 
@JesCoolbaugh Have you ever been a waitress? 
@PaulPro245 Most of my great-grandparents immigrated to USA in 1880-1910. My blood is 100% Italian. 
@Dropsofreign I'm back. Hi Leah. Awww ... it was fun talking smack to you! 
New York Yankees look strong. 18 errorless games (defense) and starting pitching that has potential to dominate in October. Watch out! 
@TheChefsWife The Daily Fork - that's a cute name. Congratulations! 
@patricew52 Just found that song. It's a good one! 
@arethridge But no matter... Colorado's mountains still have plenty of snow. A *SNOW WONDERLAND* in many places! 
@FloridaSunSales Chief has never seen the ocean. He does like water a lot. I know, I know, I need to visit Florida! 
@TheTrailhead Yes Keith, I do. You have a great selection of topo maps, among many things. 
@katjrobertson Kat, I bought this entire box *JUST FOR YOU!* http://twitpic.com/6okgj  
@Hetty4Christ ((((( BIG HUG ))))) and a snowball for you. 
@howiet1 Howie, please know I have a follow friday tradition of recommending my MS tweeps with a good ol' southern accent! 
@denvercheetoh I thought I blew it with you when I endorsed Dunkin Donuts (kicks ass baby!). Thanks friend. 
@ahouseman Thanks Adam. One of these days, I hope to meet you and the lovely @ihouseman. Someday. 
@Ozark_sky Aw thanks Ms. Ozark. I have enjoyed tweeting with you! 
@MistiPearl I don't think we have moose in Colorado. We have plenty of elk though. 
@michelleflores Okay, I'll have you know I finally rubbed the &quot;eye snot&quot; from my eyes. You and @archrlatina ought to be proud of me! 
@StillStacy Do you mean snowFALL? Are you against observing snow on the ground? Making a snowman is so much stinkin' fun! 
@TellurideLisa You think so? That's interesting! 
@tishac I'm not crazy about most of my looks, minus the hair. 
@tishac A lot of women have a problem with that. Especially those who cut their hair short because of emotional problems. Ohhhhhhhh well! 
@Hetty4Christ I want to attend a Phoenix, AZ tweet-up. ((( A tweet-up among the saguaros! ))) - Great hot weather too! 
http://twitpic.com/6s3oi - Campers &amp; rafters in Buena Vista CO. C'mon people lets go rafting! 
@patricew52 I'll help you with your bio if you like. C'mon... you gotta put something in there. 
Steely Dan - &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; (TURN YOUR SPEAKERS UP!)  ♫ http://blip.fm/~7rzm2
@michelle_cc You are welcome. I still like some of their 80's songs! 
@cllecr Sounds like fun. Tweet pictures of your cache adventures! 
@sospokesaroj It's Sunday morning. What could ya possibly be super busy about today? C'mon ... go for a bike ride or something! 
@HeatherHAL Heather, I am a &quot;closet desert&quot; lover. Ah the desert! Gotta explore Joshuta Tree NP. Gotta bike across AZ again. 
@amanda5280 And I really kiss them Amanda: Thorns to Lips! I don't mess around! 
@CallMe_Goddess Right on Courtney. You scored *MAJOR POINTS* with me from that reply. 
@CallMe_Goddess Well, you already have a lot of points with me, but seriously, you scored some more w/ that one! 
@joycecherrier I am here by myself booking raft trips when the phone rings. Doing all right. How are you? 
@earthmom22 My latest sunset was on 5/19: http://bit.ly/3GQP3  
@JesCoolbaugh That was a funny tweet. I like it! 
@Hetty4Christ I'm okay. Not working today. Trying to wake up ... what are you doing? 
@RozD I could &quot;greenify&quot; your avatar if you like. Send pic to my personal email. (stevegarufi@juno.com) - I know, I'm a stranger but... 
@QualityFrog I eat at that Subway a lot.  And dangit! You are an excellent photographer. Nice sunset colors!
@awriterafoot Yes true. I shouldn't have sounded that bad with knocking &quot;old media.&quot; Thanks for the reply! 
@CallMe_Goddess Whatever. Shut up and eat a lemon poppy seed muffin! 
@CallMe_Goddess Food is a wonderful thing, isn't it? I just ate some fried chicken! 
@kirkflorida I only got a cell phone in Sept 2007. I'm behind the times. But *I do* know these mtns - give me credit for that at least
