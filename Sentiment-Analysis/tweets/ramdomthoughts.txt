@OscarTG Morning. No sun here unfortunately 
Oh no - it's all gone to shit  http://is.gd/rc0L
@pete_c You are the invisible man in TweetDeck mate 
Any tips / websites to check out anyone about using Groups in TweetDeck? I have NO clue at all 
Now I can't spell either 
Got insurance forms for Polo. Feel a bit  Has to be done though.
@lcaller Ha ha ha LOL At least you've got someone to nudge 
Maxie has missed me today. The banging below is freaking her out a bit. You &amp; me both 
Feeling reallly knackered all of a sudden. Might have a lay down (ON MY OWN) for a bit 
@em_c Cheers Emma - no chance of that. Flat below was an auction job - now being done up = big job = loads of noise for me  Never mind eh.
Looking at Polo's form. Here goes  Will hand it in personally tomorrow instead of posting - worth the effort.
Thanks. Upsetting doing the form but expected 
@pete_c @ScottSharman  Nooooooo! Mushy peas are yuk 
That was tough  Polo's form handed in. Seeing the room again where I held him was emotional. Feel a bit  but Faithless in my ears helps.
@em_c I hate peas &amp; mushy = even worse 
@TorontoViewer That's me buggered then 
@spr33 You &amp; me both mate - I HATE all peas  yuk 
@pete_c Oh really - sad news mate 
@em_c Yep - tide completely out - no water whatsoever 
@PaulWestlake 1.5Mbps up - WTF - pathetic eh 
@acetuk Cheers. Yep - should be fine as Airport Extreme is N. 50Mbps only works on N. Sorry to hear you only get 10 
@xLilCx How sad 
@synagence I think you are right 
I have a headache 
@pete_c WWDC is tomorrow mate? ll be at college tomorrow evening - unable to watch live coverage  But yes - will be buying one.
My 20Mbps connection has slowed rightbdown to dial up ggrrr. Had enough trying to get Show 149 out tonight  - tomorrow AM hopefully.
@Artytypes No - I won't say what I was gonna say - morning 
It happens to me loads. If you reply - my ID is ramdomthoughts NOT randomthoughts - I spell it wrong deliberately. 
@jharsem Nice that you''ve changed your avatar so we know what you look like 
@Nutronic Good luck! In general mate - most job centres are like that - so out of touch 
@twinkleboi Stay calm. I'm sure he is more afraid of you, compared to you of him. Put yourself in his shoes  He's not gonna hurt you 
My camelbak has arrived - will give it a go later this evening for a run - no more dehydration  http://twitpic.com/2y8i9
@cybster That is nice - I admit 
@twinkleboi He's waiting for you - with his mates 
Right people - everyone follow @Artytypes - she's a nice lady 
@pixiec Thanks. You have something similar for your marathon training? I get really dehydrated after 6 miles - let alone 20 odd 
@twinkleboi You do a lot of talking fella - got your arse in gear (in a nice way) 
@twinkleboi Bragging again 
@twinkleboi *sigh* my wit is wasted on you some times 
@twinkleboi LOL I thought you were taken over by the devil there for a minute 
@richardepryor Thank you 
@em_c It's surprising how many people are out running at 8am. All my chores done - can now relax for the day 
@em_c Good try  Well done with the painting by the way.

@Charlotteis I'm an expert in body langugage - if that helps - seriously. I was employed for that very skill - the body never lies 
@Charlotteis The bad points  is trying to pretend that I'm not noticing and make small talk 
@Charlotteis No bugger would believe me. I should have put money on it - would have cleaned up! 
@geekachu I have a Prodigy mashup on my next show - Prodigy vs Rihanna. It sounds better than it reads 
@ksymmonds Don't say in 10 mins - I'm rough as 
@ksymmonds Popcorn for dinner - yummy! 
I look rough as ........ do I post a pic for votes. Shave or no shave - YOU DECIDE? ha 
@geekachu Call yourself a geek ......... sssshhhh *whispers* don't blame ya  If it's shit, I' asking for me money back P
Have'nt been to the cinema for ages ........... quite looking forward to it now. If I'm tweeting at about 9pm - you know it's SHIT LOL 
If that ninja spammer rears his head one more time - you are gonna get it fella *bows*

@misspka Awesome! I love geeky shows - Gadget Show &amp; Big Bang Theory are my top two. Morning 
@carole29 Ha  I shall not make mentioned said lady earlier blush with a response to that one 
Must remember to put new skill on CV = Twitter, eat &amp; watch TV all at the same time. Potential employees -watch out - look sharp!

@ksymmonds Ha Morning mate. I have that every day - best ring the nut house now - I'll start packing me bags

I am now ZIPPING IT - for real - otherwise I'm for the chop at college tonight - no thankies. Might see me later aligator 
Now going - any replies appreciated - thank you in advance 
@PaulWestlake Cheers. Technology does'nt always go the way I hope. Should be sorted later. I needed to get up anyway  Enjoy your day.
@OscarTG Morning mate. I so miss Outlook since I left work - NOT! 
@wirobchen Tell me about it 
@geekachu Ha. I like how we both sometimes don't get each other's phrases. It means (here) = jealous you had more sleep than me 
@xLilCx Thanks - you too 
@SarahSymmonds You have a cheeky sense of humour. I'm gonna like you LOL 
@SarahSymmonds Does'nt he know where the kitchen is - lazy sod - give him a slap 
@xLilCx Ha - I like that saying LOL 
@geekachu @xLilCx Ha It would have matched my poor attempt at growing a goatee beard 
@carole29 I admire your self control 
@carole29 Me too, and I'm not even chuffing dressed either 
@geekachu Just checking 
@ksymmonds Yawn - put another record on ha ha  You know I'm only messing 
I'm taking a breather from this Show 148 balls up. My 70,000 download fan club will have to wait I'm afraid 
It's alright ...... my ego got a bit carried away there ....... now back in control - phew! Got a bit scary there for a minute 
@Artytypes Buy another one 
@PaulWestlake Oh right - explains it totally. The DMC mixes were the standard DJs material  ie DJs that are too lazy to do it for real 
@swannny Have a fab time 
@geekachu Morning - follow Friday? Am I seeing things? You feeling ok? Thank you 
Morning. Staying up until 3am - maybe not my best ideal. Still in bed of course! Thanks for follow Fridays all you lovely people

@pete_c Ooohh - never played that 
@spr33 Factor 15! You mad! 20 minimum if your skin isn't adapted to the sun &amp; I'm guessing your's isn't? Nag over 
@SarahSymmonds Good - me too 
I can see you @pete_c in my friends list. Just downloading Wipeout now and gonna have a play

@ksymmonds Sorry to hear that mate - see ya at 10am 
@OscarTG Good luck with that mate! Morning BTW 
@richardepryor Oh yes - have to complete form for Polo. Cool thing though - Matt Horne is telling people about my mashup &amp; remix podcast 
@richardepryor Ha ha 
@OscarTG More like a bloody good idea - liking your style  Why did'nt I think of that at 6.50am when I was doing some ironing.
@PaulWestlake My pleasure mate 
Word of warning @ksymmonds &amp; @SarahSymmonds - I might be early okay  Will leave mine at 9.30am 
@ksymmonds Okay - I'll leave in next 5 mins then. On me way 
Meditation time - been a while. iPhone off, everything off - not here for an hour (literally) 
The neighbours are gonna hate me tomorrow. I'm having a Depeche Mode evening 
@dsushee Ha ha ha WRONG  But I appreciate your honesty 
@ksymmonds Glad to hear it fella  Children all knackered out ?
@reetsjel In honour of Dave - get well soon fella 
@PeterApokotos Me too mate. However, you can't some times expect the same quality in others. I know what you mean 
World In My Eyes .... now the neighbours are gonna HATE ME ! Volume up 
I've decided, I'm going through every single Depeche Mode album I've got until I fall asleep at my keyboard. Living on the edge! 
@ksymmonds @SarahSymmonds My pleasure - great site - use it a lot for me iPhone ringtones 
@ksymmonds @SarahSymmonds I think I've even got mashups of them. Will have to dig out a track for a future show 
Now I'm on Music For The Masses - Depeche Mode if you are wondering and not educated in the art of the Mode 
@TorontoViewer Agree 
@TorontoViewer Most definitely. I end up eating the whole lot in one go though 
@pete_c You are catching me up mate. I've done 11, 186 tweets 
@pete_c LOL all total rubbish mind LOL  I'm great at talking bollocks LOL 
Feels like I'm living above a building site. Actually - I am! Poor Maxie is freaking out a bit, so extra attention etc  Morning BTW 
@em_c I'm more concerned how the noise freaks Maxie out really. She's getting loads of attention though to make up for it 
Polo's form completed. Now I'm gonna fill in an RSPCA donation direct debit form to counteract the sadness &amp; do something GREAT 
@em_c Indeed 
@an0key Who hasn't? 
@lcaller Ha ha ha LOL please keep posting those - fantastic mate! Not for you though - but SO makes me giggle 
Just had a chat with bloke downstairs - rennovating. Doing it himself - nice fella - place a mess - will moan less (ish) 
@lcaller Love this security stuff! 
Early finish at college - walking home. Some great E3 coverage on Twitter - many thanks for posting everyone! 
@paulmonkey You should end up eating less though - hopefully 
@geekachu I understand what you mean though 
@dsushee @lcaller LOL no  Just hacking his ATV 
@TorontoViewer Are your DMs working? Just sent you one 
Why do I get music ideas at this time? I should be going to bed. Oh well ... another hour won't hurt 
@SupaSaz Enjoy your day 
I am thinking about Show 149. No idea when I'm gonna record it yet, but I'm thinking about it - a good sign I think 
@SupaSaz Will do  Need to get dressed me thinks - the day is disappearing before my eyes 
@longpier A lot better now mate - thank you for asking 
I am gonna be pimping Tom's latest podcast show later on tonight as well - it's srsly fantastic stuff 
I'm running out of space on my iPhone. I srsly need to catch up on some podcasts while I'm out and about in the sunSHINE 
@ScottSharman Cod &amp; chips with a splash of tommy sauce please fella - ta 
Now sitting outside Starbucks watching the world go by 
@Charlotteis Yes - on my Mac &amp; iPhone - fab software 
@Charlotteis Oh right - thanks  Nah - I've not even started yet LOL 
Can I buy a six pack please? I'm not talking about beer 
@geekachu Morning. I have a private network here with Airport Extreme - if it doesn't clash - will be hard to resist I think 
@andymurd Reviews have been mixed but I never take any notice. Thanks 
£50 a month for Virgin Media's 50Mbps. About £14 more a month that I currently pay. They chuck in a free N router. I have Airport Extreme 
@spr33 Is'nt that a bit wrong though - pretending you want to leave? What deal did you get? I'm listening LOL  You with VM also?
@cardiacs Ha ha ha  Look at yr Twitter. I suspect they will go in 5 .. 4 .. 3 .. 2
Blimey, I only have 21 video podcasts left to watch on my ATV. I still have 140GB worth of TV though 
@swannny Google Reader. If you have an iPhone - install Byline &amp; it integrates with Google Reader = offline reading - very cool 
@spr33 Ta. You've not answered my Q though. You with VM? What deal did you get? DM me if you prefer 
@newbornskyfire Definately. Morning BTW 
@twinkleboi Blimey - you can't give it away. Not my cup of tea - otherwise I'd go with ya 
@newbornskyfire Good luck - but don't get mugged 
@pete_c Indeed - hope to see more of it 
@emclev Have a safe trip &amp; lovely day 
@MummaBear @pete_c CFC? Should I ask? LOL 
@AlGalpin Thanks - love reading blogs - that's why I asked 
@TheDarrenxshow Cheers - will chk it out &amp; get back to you 
@TorontoViewer Thanks - already figured that one out 
@justinfleming LOL probably 
@Emmkat Love the art work! Whereabouts in Japan are you? I bet it's great eh 
@carole29 Nothing wrong with that. Showing yr emotions is good *hug* 
@newbornskyfire  @djcopycat Very true
