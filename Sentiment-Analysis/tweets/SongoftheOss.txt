@ABOResearch Pleased to hear it, but still I am shamed sometimes to hear what some men do 
@Applecored what I do now  anyhoo thanks for the *spank* :-O x
night to @applecored - the light dims as you leave the chat room 
@ThisStarChild aww please explain &quot;botts&quot; I am all 'fused.... 
@_CorruptedAngel that's an insult to rats 
@LindseytheFirst you can but @thisstarchild doesn't know either - I must have one secret surely 
@KillerSalad could be worse, my f'ing &quot;fitness&quot; regime won't allow chocolate - welcome to the world of fruit 
@dontforgetchaos I think it might 
@LindseytheFirst well tell that to @dharmaduck she's the one &quot;judging&quot; me....  *sympathy*
@SapphyNo1 @bigassbadger - I am getting the same profile appearing as well - someone must have put together some kind of bot, damn them 
@the_apostate yes, precisely, you're not to wind me up - especially as I've work today  should I remote control servers while tweeting?
@ThisStarChild just so you know clothes aren't my photographic medium :-O I am off to work soon as well  *hug*

@Jayne0807 oh no they still there, how long does it have to take! I wish you an empty road though - too hot for long drive 
Is it you get past 150 followers and all of a sudden bots are activated to hound you  Where are the rest of the real people?
For @Applecored as I go offline and head into the hell that is work  *hugs* ? http://blip.fm/~7bgtt
