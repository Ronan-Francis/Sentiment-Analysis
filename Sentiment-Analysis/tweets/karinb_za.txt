@astynes Count yrself VERY lucky! It's so frustrating.  It's bots that are spamming twitter.

@blindcripple I need coffee.  I'm so sick of these cats. 
@astynes Yeh I hate them.  I told R this morning I'm having a 3-some today, me E and J. :-p
*whine whinge moan* I don't wanna work today.  It's chaos here and *I* have to sort it out... Anyone wanna meet for drinks at the beach??
