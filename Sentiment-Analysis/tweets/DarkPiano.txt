@aliholden Not good, I hate that! 
@k8dt Quite welcome! I get blipped every now and then through what I have at imeem, but they recently changed to 30-second clips! 
@userpong Understandable, and I agree. Unfortunately, marketers are marketers. 
@theladywrites Indeed it is.  Wishing you and your husband and all others healing...
@musicstr7 Oh no!  Feel better soon!
@suesshirtshop Same to you, Sue!
