@erinkellygaines Don't let that be it  I was going to give up and then he tweeted. Perhaps I should get into that mindframe again.
@DWsCoverGirl1  I wish I could give you a better answer, but I haven't seen all of them yet 
@DWsCoverGirl1  you have sleeping problems?  I am the lightest sleeper there is  I feel  every movement and hear every sound
@stacy_nkotbluva I did sort of, but it just sucks that you have to lower your api's so you aren't gettting instant updates 
What a disappointing night  Jon usually chimes in between 1-2 and nothing  Can't go to sleep for anpther 5 mins, daughter just woke up
@dannywood @jonathanrknight @jordanknight @donniewahlberg @joeymcintyre So I am offcially giving up  I never have good intuition 
@lizluvsJK I bet, but it was excitement that didn't get us anywhere  LOL
@Raquel1989 I'm with you and @karla_martin76 I think it was unfair as well, but what can we do now? There were no rules stated 
@DannyGirlAlways I will ttyl, I feel bad for leaving you 
@DannyGirlAlways Ok I still feel kind of bad though  I will make it up to you later on, on here  I promise!!
@wicked12 NICE!!! I wish someone would say my name 
@KristieW77 Good night, sorry you missed Donnie 
@soaps3 I sorry, I will stop 
@soaps3 WHAT????? PB COOKIES? And you didn't share? I thought we were sisters 
@lizluvsJK I wish I knew about a job. I haven't worked in 3 months, damn economy 
JOn has 1 hour to tweet or i'm out  Jon Jon Jon Jon Jon his name is Jon
@lizluvsJK As a teacher,I am sure you are safe. i worked at a dealership,not so safe, lol. Laid off  But glad I was,I was miserable there
@jonathanrknight You are killing us you know???!!! We need to know about the rattlesnake, you can't leave us hanging on here 
@lizluvsJK He has and we appreciate it. But Danny is mmm mmm good, I could do without all of the tattoos though 
I need to get out of my own head, not good 
@soaps3 OK sounds good, get some sleep tonight. I am applying for jobs, not that I want a job, but I have to have one 
Twitter, what a lonely place it is tonight 
@DannyGirlAlways I didn't know you watched more than 1. I have only seen 2 of his movies, I think  I need to start looking for them on TV
@CarlosPoulet Same here. I don't see my bed before 4-5AM (central time)anymore   Plus I am out of a job, so I have nowhere to be but home
@jimmymarsh617 Damn Jimmy, where is the love? I need to be cheered up tonight 
@jimmymarsh617 I heard nothing, wasn't there. Illinois is too far 
OMG, I am here FINALLY!!! I was out and having fun tonight, forgive my absence  Let's get this!!
@wicked12 I saw your texts, I just didn't have enough battery life to respond 
@soaps3 NO not early at all, I think she said 2:10 or something like that, poor baby. I am a bad mommy 
@soaps3 Me too  I am a bad daughter, no church going for me. I hope to sleep until noon again tomorrow, lol
@LuvinDanny4Ever Why thank you, my baby is still sleeping. Unfortunately I couldn't sleep more than 3 hours 
@HOTTVampChick Uh-oh, are you canceling your twitter account? Please say that aint so 
@acj80 @Coley81 LOL, that's true Danny wouldn't have that. So you have to quit anyways   Dustin sounds like a good guy 
I miss @wwicked12 I hope she is feeling better. I need my other half 
I miss @wicked12 I hope she is feeling better. I need my other half 
@soaps3 Be thankful, I thought I would get some lost tweeting time in just no the case  NOW I will be
@LuvinDanny4Ever Anything else going on besides API's? I can;t believe we haven't had any late night tweeting for nearly a week 
@LuvinDanny4Ever Sorry, my internet stopped responding, I hate my new carrier 
Ok i am back and have been for a few unfortunately the hubby isnt drunk enough to just go to bed. So he is online instead 
There are people bouncing off walls, and people being smelly and greasy, I am lost 
@wicked12 Stop tormenting that poor doggy 
@InLuvwithJON I need to get me one of those, damnit for not having a job 
@lizluvsJK Absolutely, until we have to get in line for 5* at least  But I am hoping to be last in line, keeping my fingers crossed 
@InLuvwithJON LOL, yah we don't need you orange for Tinley  You are lucky that you are able to tan, it sucks being as pale as we are 
@InLuvwithJON Hey now don't rain on my parade  I was getting all excited about it.
@lizluvsJK Not really, a little bummed that none of the guys tweeted not even our boy Jordan 
@ktsummer Aww, have a good last night aboard the ship. Back to land and reality tomorrow  Thanks for tweeting 
@HOTTVampChick Yah, just a couple of drinks, perhaps I am putting on you what I want for myself, lmao. Going stir crazy in here 
Ok hubby really isnt going to be logging off anytime soon  what to do what to do?
@wicked12 No you didn't I guess I just suck 
@hilarylyn I sorry  I hope you figure it out soon!
@hilarylyn Is that where he came from? I felt a little out of the loop 
@lizluvsJK they were and i couldn't do much about it  being at my friends house prevented me from tweeting
Well girls, I think my time has come for me to go  I still have to straighten my hair and be up by 9, wish me luck 
@DannysGirlinSFL You don't have a profile picture either 
@DannysGirlinSFL I don't see it  you have that lovely red x in the left hand corner.
@KentuckyTour You teasem you can't do that to us. 
@YoungQ Damn I don't get any shoutouts, I sad 
@soaps3 I will, but odds are that I woo will be in bed within the next half hour 
@enricoeric It is and I try and drink the expected quota every day. Uaually doesn't happen though 
@hilarylyn Oh wow, well that's closer than the rest of us have been , lol. Sorry you had to go through a waffle house ordeal though 
Well I think I better be going to bed now  I want to stay up, but I know I have a toddler that won't sleep in as long as myself, lol.
