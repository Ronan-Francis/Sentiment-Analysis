@shadowcelery ohnoes  we had a tank, one healer, and two/three? dps do it
@admon09 Someone told me they are canceling this too  but I'm not sure. It is really good though, watching it on hulu.
Starting watching Fringe recently, it needs more creepy stuff  and I missed the first few episodes!
@Cadistra I wanted more princess less frog  but oh well~ looks amazing anyway.
@mckrout Blarg, yeah, not by choice 
@Rilgon It's broken \o/ I dunno  bleh~ good thing I haven't been paying too much attention to twitter today.
@mongstradamus I never really feel well, I have a lot of health problems so my body is pretty weak~ 
@mongstradamus Nah  not enough people showed up~ maybe a little more monday, I'm going to try doing them every off night.
@plutokiss I hate Freya in general~  such a clusterfuck.
@plutokiss Bleh yeah  our dps have problems attacking the wrong target and stopping dps when asked~
@mongstradamus D'aw  yeah, although I'm sort of bad with that~ always forget if I've gotten a text if I'm doing something!
@mckrout D'aw~  that is sad, it is super warm here! Come! Joooooin meee~
@PixelExecution Aww!  when this kitty was a (adorable) kitten I was still living out in va so I only saw him every other month for a while
@Brunty Blarg~  took sleepy medicine because I was in a lot of pain, was hoping it was keep me asleep for longer.
@Adi74 Can't get back to sleep, no  went to bed pretty early though, was feeling crappy after raid.
@epicwinmaster I'll always love you  even if you turn into a zombie.
.@etherjammer but yeah  I don't read the site, someone linked that to me
@brigwyn 5'1~! I am really tiny! :O These are my new ones: http://tinyurl.com/r4mbs4 not as cute 
@omgitsafox D'aw~  I would give you ( a very bad, but I would try! ) back rub. If you get my shoulders/neck &gt;:3
@_erica Awwwwww  yeah that is teh lame.
@_erica Nyeah it feels like that  one of the other top horde guilds isn't as bad, I respect them.
@kesoleil It's alright, just felt like you thought I was saying all top guilds are assholes  so I was worried.
@Katarinea Oh wow  ouch...
@_erica I know right 
Sadness  The top horde guild that I liked disbanded.
@Medros Haha~ probably not  Come down to Cali!
@dhollinger D'aw, night night! Nothing planned here except trying for blizzcon tickets again 
@Corey_B Hmmmm sorry I can't be of any help 
@Medros We haven't been talking about anything! 
@Doug_Williams But feel just as bad! 
,@epicwinmaster Theres a new tree app too~  do not want.
@Kenichan @etherjammer Yeah~  I have *terrible* anxiety problems so during pugs I pretty much hold my breath until someone says Im alright
@Kenichan *patpat* that always sucks 
@fynralyl Hm  thats not very nice,  no, but they might just want to keep the gear in guild.
@Brunty Creepy... 
Awesome guildies did not get blizzcon tickets  hopefully they will get them some other way~
Hospitals are scary 
@brigwyn Yepyep, they want to do more tests... but I'm really not sure 
@shizukera Yeah  I have arthritis as well, just turned 18, but I've had it since I was 13.
@shizukera Yeah  weird huh? My mothers side of the family all has it. Didn't start really acting up till last year.
@sunshinecelery *hug* 
Sleepysleepy but someone is supposed to come by  don't wanna miss them~
Also boyfriend wants to follow me around at bcon - hopefully it won't be too awkard for people I want to meet 
@softthistle *hug* 
@Doug_Williams Lawl~ I would not look good in a little bikini  trying to not have to wear something like that for Ysera
@brigwyn My legs are really tiny when I'm standing up  it looks pretty odd, I just don't do a lot of walking and have no muscle
@variel *patpat*  I haven't been doing any heavy lifting, except like a watermelon - lawl. Now it's moved down to my hands~
@etherjammer Hmmm  *patpat*
 Really random incredibly bad chest pains, ouch.
@sunshinecelery I blame @epicwinmaster  she had a link to wikipedia about a type of spider.
@PixelExecution Ohnoes  *patpat*
@deelah Can't stand plain ones (well maybe the mini ones, just because they are fun to eat)  don't like chocolate unless it has nuts/PB!
I want to go to the bookstore~ 
Oof, full tummy  should not have eaten so much.
Hmmm  going to be missing our best healer and best dps Sunday~ Hopefully enough for a few Yogg tries.
@deelah Awww  why? *hugs*
@dhollinger &quot;tweetdeck, why are you such a whore?  I thought we had something.&quot;
@str1fe Taco salads can be yummy!  I was hoping.
@str1fe Neh, boy doesn't like salad  so we never pick up salad stuff~
Cramps  *curls up in a ball and cries*
@Cadistra the second kind  the worst~ let me see if I can find some tea.
Guildie asked me if I wanted to do U10 hard modes with another guild  not really keen on it.
@Liferoot It's his friend, and an officer  so... yeah.
I tree tanked the little flowers near Freya, lived, but the mean tree guys  owie.
So not going on to Vexas  as we only have 22.
owiepains  *healing pot*
@eiruko Awww  I thought you enjoyed them?

@etherjammer Just feeling shitty 
@ColeBennett Yeah  Retaliation? Ugh.
@Corey_B No clue at all 
@ColeBennett Yeah  ughugh, if it doesn't get fixed tonight we might just change the raid nights.

@_anea IT WAS MY FIRST ONE  and great~
@omgitsafox I don't mind it so much, I used to be *really* tiny so having curves is niiice  although often frustrating.
@Medros Hehe! I'll take your word on that  ?
@KirstiTappenden  Woot! One vote for down.
@psynister What @Tigorasou said 
Ah  The movement in InFamous is so much fun.
@variel Technically she appears as the same race as who ever she is talking to

@LordArturis Hmm I use Bagon, Bartender, Tekjunkseller (I think e.e), Hate questing! but I have Carbonite, do use Sexymap though 
@Katarinea Hehe  Who are you on LJ~?
@irrationallogic Hehe  Jealous, I'm in Cali so it doesn't change too much.
