@Mezhead Sorry to hear the relationship with cheezels has come to an end  Very, very sad. Are you sure it wasn't a one-off?
@Lyrical_Gangsta Sadly, no. Totally erased from the list 
@missgiggly Jealous! Scalp massages are the best. And hand, and feet... I want a massage now 
@AimeeLady That is sad   I have my fave ones on my blog, how dare they not let you add it!! The hide! lol
@Kat_La I kept turning him around, but he wouldn't take no for an answer 
@aussiecynic Hey... that is terrible   I hope they will be ok!
@architeuth1s But I don't wanna go to bed   (nice fun police!)
@Mezhead Princess Mez, I hope you get better soon  It was great to see you last night!
@Boy_Kill_Boy That is ridiculous  how long has it been like that for?
@Boy_Kill_Boy What's changed? are you worried about something? 
@missgiggly Oh no!! Bet it kills... poor thing  Were you at least buying something nice for yourself?
@salandpepper Jealous! I wish I still had half of Sunday to go.. bed time soon for me   *throws little tantrum*
@Denkar1891 Weekend is over in 15mins...   Party last night, so chillaxed in an attempt to recover today.. lol
@BecaBear I wish it was still the weekend

@Queen_Of_Tarts Don't go to work 
@BecaBear Mondays blow. But glad you two are still alive 
@BecaBear I know!! It will be the best day ever  It had better rain!
@BecaBear @Mezhead I don't know!! Am praying for rain so something cozy, but comfortable and nice at the same time... if it exists 
@BecaBear Work was boring today too... which is why I left at 3:30 
@BecaBear @Mezhead Trip to Italy to met RP and KS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I plan on checking it out next week when it starts 
@BecaBear You know what they say, more than a handful is a waste  by wish, lyrical, etc. still, entertaining though

@ginger_s Happy Birthday for today!!!! Definitely catch up soon  Should try to get a uni reunion going.... one day
