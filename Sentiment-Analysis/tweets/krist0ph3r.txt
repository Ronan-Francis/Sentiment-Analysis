@mokshjuneja yesh it's a bank holiday but everyone else is working. trains, traffic, everything screwed as usual 
@Shadez err the storm has ended. not sure who's been devastated more

unfortunately work rears it's ugly head again. looks like today is gonna be a mostly offline day 
@VIOLETT but lonavla is too close by! it's barely 45 minutes from panvel! i'll spend more time getting to panvel first 
never realized how much mango juice I dropped onto the newspaper. pop is gonna have a fit when he gets home! 
@shaktijs oooh okie!!! but i missed yesterday's 
@punkpolkadots try and rope bodhi in for sure...and what's with might and all? cmon, i've dropped all my schedule for the weekend! 
@Anujaah I know...what to do...treating guy is a veggie 
@Anujaah i'm not scared of you or the tricks of the trade...i'm scared of @shaaqt! 
@gryphusnick @CruciFire I wish it was super moolah, but superMooha is apparently all I can possibly get 
@burbleon i was gonna say come on gtalk, but it's time to leave now 
@meerasapra i love your comics!!! can you improve your blog's look/layout etc though? it's kinda crappy right now 
@shaaqT i got paid on friday...and i'm already feeling poor!!! 
@Spitphyre no kung fu fighting with me when i'm depressed and alone on a sunday night. it just isn't right 
@punkpolkadots i have my mommy, but life isn't any easier 
@punkpolkadots i know, my life is cushioned that way...but having my mommy around doesn't help much beyond that...it's complicated 
@Spitphyre naah no singing. i wanna cry 
@Shadez @CruciFire i got over 95%!!! 90% on the home page, but mostly other peoples' tweets to me 
@Reinaluna awwww well i don't think a new job will cheer you up all that much, unless you're unemployed 
feeling completely out of sorts. good food might help, but i don't have my bike today 
@UrmiRaj14 kebabs are awesome...for everything except my health 
@unitechy yeah, don't worry, you will!!! there's still a week and a half before we hit the roads - this weekend's fully booked for me 
@hardik that's one of the downsides of my job. no stock dealing shealing allowed!!! 
@hardik i know man...but ethics and all 
@Anusual oh no, he was in management 
@unitechy hehe well that's life! you can atleast afford to buy yourself a house once you start working 
@Asfaq you lucky fellow!!! i'm still at work...and no sign of leaving anytime soon 
@Asfaq yeah well i turned up at like 12:30pm...so yeah, i guess you have a point 
@shaaqT but the name is so cute!!! you shouldn't keep such cute names for people you don't want me to meet 
@Enamoredsoul gotten outta bed, breakfasted, now planning to get back in because the friends I was supposed to hang out with arnt enthu!! 
@Enamoredsoul i hate sitting at home on weekends. going back to sleep now 
@mahafreed see that's why 
@mehulved nope...from trauma to the thorax 
@Spitphyre well i'm on vodafone...so the grief is mostly yours 
blogger has been unblocked at work - at last!!! job satisfaction just went up a couple of notches 
@UrmiRaj14 yeah...DUI is not my kinda thing. tried it once, got freaked out by the way i rode. cops or no cops, i'm not doing it again!!! 
@Spitphyre well what to do...i have friends from all walks of life...i don't discriminate based on intelligence or evolutionary status 
@Shadez yeah, diet coke is better than water/soda + lemon cordial. also, gin + tonic water + soda + lemon cordial is a good low cal combo 
@Spitphyre corona/heineken is good, but somehow i don't like bud any more. carlberg is better 
@imnogeek she sells sea shells on the sea shore but the shells she sells are sea shore shells 
@Chet6 well bandra west is (almost) in on the coast, so both 
@unitechy of course!!! we love you as much as you love us, if not more  #yaymen
@rehabc thankie!!! *takes a bow* 
my cousin is dating someone who has the same name as her dad. and her dad, mom and sister have the same initials as she does. #CONFUSION! 
@b50 if they let go of their skirts the markets would probably rise even more!!! 
@ankita_gaba haha I think we should let the topic drop now. a quick poll would settle the matter if you don't believe me 
the voter paint just peeled off my skin. or maybe my skin just peeled off with the voter paint 
@rohanbabu I brought a buffalo 320gb for 3800...it has the fastest transfer rate for a usb hdd...I benchmarked it at 34mb/s on my comp!!! 
@rehabc give him a gift voucher for something like shoppers' stop or something. that's as good as cash. unless he's immigrating, that is! 
@ceetee i'll be trying it tomorrow. it's dloading as we speak 
@iMBA haha don't thank me yet. i'm still at your place 
@UrmiRaj14 heya urmi...just read your tweets and realized what happened...all the best!!! hope you manage to get your copyright enforced. 
@fubar69 haha wtf!!! i like being clean...until i spill my drink, that is 
@Suksy hehe yeah of course! selective tweeting during breaks is allowed...like right now 
@jayesh haha...dude it's not about the battery life, but my productivity! wanna stay away from unproductive diversions...I have an xperia 
@Saurabh naah @punkpolkadots is riding pillion. people are tentatively adding themselves still...so let's see 
@Anujaah ahhh I never knew you're a fish! guess that's the correct term 
turned the volume up too high to hear my phone's beeps. guess I might as well turn off twitter, switch it off and let it charge. toodles! 
@shaaqT more like a twdevil for me. wonder why no one else can see the horns through the fake halo 
@mehulved hmmm I was half expecting you to join in yourself 
@aalaap oh that way. I remember writing awesome viruses and sending them as links in my teenage years though 
@bhas get something small. like a quart or something 
@b50 just turn email notifications on, and delete the spam when you see it. captchas irritate your genuine readers for no fault of theirs 
previous tweet should read as wasted and not drunk. parents are already very sure i'm drunk 
@NerdIndian nobody can make you feel inferior, but it's easy to make you look inferior. ask me 
@NerdIndian true true. hence the statement: &quot;aadmi ko apna chutiyapa katana chahiye&quot;. oh wait, that wasn't funny. sorry 
@NerdIndian it means you should be willing to be/to be made a chutiya when the occasion arises. why you should is the subject of the joke 
@unitechy it will be awesome in the rains na!! plus if we go this weekend, i'll have to stay sober this saturday night. i don't like that 
@fubar69 twitter tries to disguise all their outages behind weird errors. sounds exactly like me explaining to my boss why work isnt done 
@CruciFire i wouldn't say too much. i drank just the right amount of stuff to make me do crazy things. had one red bull too many though!! 
@Spitphyre hehe...in the words of aerosmith...PINK...COS YOU ARE SO VERY!!! 
if i said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me? I WISH!!! 
@mystic19 too much!!! 
@Harishk oh okay...yeah, kool. i was too fast asleep to answer the phone anyway 
@givemeaname13 doesn't look a day over 5 
@Spitphyre no drinking and riding, babes!!! my sad life isn't *that* sad for me to turn suicidal! a couple of drinks would be nice though 
@ankitdaf interesting! i've never roamed on cellOne, but i'm guessing it should be fine. i have postpaid so no worries 
@Shadez no man. just a moment of depression. no hangovers involved 
@mystic19 i've rarely seen more than sccattered drizzles at the start of june in 25 years..last year was probably the only exception, no? 
@ekalavyab maybe it was a failed bungee jump from the topmost branch  but seriously, why don't you get it out yourself in the meantime? 
@meerasapra haha in that case, my bad! i shall blame it on the weather 
anyone wanna accompany me to plant saplings in thane on saturday (6th) morning? reply asap!!! the ngo, &quot;hariyali&quot; is organising it 
@Reinaluna awww yeah hmmm...there are better ways to cheer up, i guess. try beign happy that it wasn't you or any of your friends 
lights out...and it's barely past midnight!!! wtf!!! am i in the wrong house? atleast dad's still watching tv 
@Spitphyre are you sure it's akon? lots of trash sounds like akon. actually, akon sounds like a lot of trash 
@Shadez yep, my sony xperia has a microSD card too...i think the xperia is the first msd based phone 
@ankita_gaba happy people call whatever happens to them, good 
@wanderblah the timing's perfect!!! i'll stick around till 9:30 or so 
@ap00rv when you say apple, i do think of the fruit. and when you say apple ipod, i don't know which ipod you're talking about 
@winniedepoohi hehe yesh! but i'm gonna get it perfectly right next time! 
@Tuoni they're having enough sales to not bother with troublesome customers like yourself!!! who wants to answer queries? 
@hardik @shaaqT i'm not sure which boat you're talking about. maybe you need to plug the leaks!!! 
@hardik haha only a true guju can think like a gujju #quote 
@aparnaandhare haha i'll just recommend that @MeghnaK follow @aalaap and then my contribution to her loss of innocence will be negligible 
@unitechy more funny than embarrassing i'd say!!! what is busting (as a noun) anyway? sounds like geekspeak for &quot;material of the bust&quot;!!! 
@ideasmithy @anaggh yesh, the debate ends here. i'm too attached to both! 
@aalaap haha so i don't need to worry then 
pop just overheard me curse under my breath, for the first time in his life. surprise on his face was priceless!! so much for impressions 
timeout from twitter...i need to bike to work, and then get something useful done! toodles! 
@Enamoredsoul i'm not sure...probably looked at the clock and said &quot;fuckin' shit!&quot; or something of the sort 
@wanderblah it did it did! it drizzled around 1, and then in the morning from 4 or so till 7 (@manimeow claims it stopped at 6:45 tho) 
@jayesh no, definitely not a spambot! her profile has  2000+ followers, but she barely follows some 800 people..looks human enough to me! 
@anaggh haha sure! daaru tweetup never needs an agenda...just a place and time! lemme know mate 
@LimeIce hehe...is the secret project #yaymen related? 
@Enamoredsoul no no, i said the opposite...i said that even when an action seems ugly, the outcome can (eventually) be beautiful 
@crazytwism what stupid apps? i'm mostly on facebook mobile. it's as if apps don't exist for me! 
@unitechy @hardik not in my part of the suburbs 
@anaggh @Netra @kitz007 @Asfaq @kapilb @aalaap so there is a daaaaru tweetup then. where/when? 
@saaket do they allow incoming connections? mith mtnl, i can remore desktop into my comp from my cellphone no matter where i am!!! 
@shaaqT awright..so what is your deadline then? silence can only fuel speculation! 
@shaaqT awrighty then!!! if i'm alive on sunday i'll take you out for a late lunch near ur place 
@Shadez dude!!! you're targeting the symptom, not the problem!!! 
@Enamoredsoul well my best friends are on a total 80s trip...whenever we go on drives or on nights out drinking, it's 80s all the way!!!! 
@Enamoredsoul true, that!!! my best times with my friends have been without music...wow, i'm tripping again!!! 
@Enamoredsoul hmmmm...i can't survive without road trips...i aim to do one every month...usually end up doing more! 
@Enamoredsoul hehe yeah I can tell...but i'd never know how it feels cos i've always had majority of my cousins living in bbay 
@Enamoredsoul and i'm heading out for lunch with @punkpolkadots!!! my sunday has finally taken off...thanks to misplaced keys and twitter 
@shaaqT it takes everything except good times to know who are your real best friends 
@Sengupta @yuvipanda IMO, 15 minutes to zero is the time you should start to panic. before that, it's all cool
