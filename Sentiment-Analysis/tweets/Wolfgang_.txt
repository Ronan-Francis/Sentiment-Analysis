Sh*t, i have this song stuck in my head;  http://bit.ly/eh9ij 
@mizhalle I want to go to Japan too! 
Is stuck in API hell... 
@GrowlyBear There's nary a long weekend in sight! 
@rumpledoodles lift doors, I can deal with. What's scarier are fingers getting caught in a door frame. 
@ctham I cannot read mandarin for nuts... 
@rumpledoodles not going. Engaged elsewhere .. 
Traffic jam along aye before lower delta exit. M/cyclist injured. Looks bad. 
My TweetDeck is languishing in API Hell. Again. 
Dreamt that my Macbook caught fire 
@mhisham dont remind me... i felt miserable when i woke up... 
Doesn't understand why he has been so tense &amp; quick to snap. 
@misskely pls don't sneak out. 
Not looking forward to his utilities bill for this month after all the cold showers and the use of the air conditioner every other night. 
@kopigao i can see where your dilemma lies....  tough call... i dont envy you...
@jinnpod too late.  it's done...
Aaarrrggh!! Attack of the horny kitty! 
@serenetan yeah... 
@rumpledoodles yes. Oooh 
Nursing a headache. 
@jinnpod you're near and yes. All sound but no action... 
@valska I'm nursing a headache too... 
Just hit my funny bone ~really~ hard. *hand goes numb* 
@untrainedninja I use tweetdeck for my mb while I use tweetie for my iPhone but once I get stuck in API he'll, both apps don't work. 
@ctham same here actually...  hang in there. Hope a #bumfondle helps. A little goes a long way... ;)
Is royally pissed that his check in lugguage is lost. Somewhere. All items bought are gone. 
@ebelle it was fun but I'm absolutely miserable my check in lugguage is lost. 
@feicho no idea. I'm feeling quite miserable waiting for news of what has become of it. 
@jakiteo yes. What the... indeed 
@mizhalle well, it's not as bad as a crash I'm sure.  oh well... We'll see when SATs call me...
@trineeE thank you. I hope so too. 
@feicho it's insured. But the feeling sure sucks...  
Is feeling a strange sense of melancholy. Not sure if it's because of lost lugguage, mom's impending chemotherapy session. 
I'm going to bed with a heavy heart. Good night world. I pray tomorrow will be a much better day. 
The chemo session is starting 30 mins late at 930 instead. The waiting isn't helping anyone. 
Sitting in the day therapy room. It's abt to start. Pls pls pls be well mom. I think I'm even more scared than she is. She's so brave. 
@mizhalle I feel like such a chicken shit trying not to cry holding her hand when she's the one under going treatment. 
@Qierann VERY VERY sian....  
Suffering from a bad bad case of equipment lust after seeing his friend buy the new MBP.  
@chloefair SQ.  I am heading off to lodge a report to facilitate my insurance claims soon. Lets see how fast NTUC processes my claims.
@jinnpod Yeap. ~All~ gone.  
@jinnpod the only momento is the pair of jeans I'm wearing.  I do hope it comes back to me as well. There goes my Divoom itour speakers.
For camera-aficionados , check out the new Olympus Pen;  http://bit.ly/MGshl Another instance of equipment lust. 
@LouiseYourQueen Back in Sg. Without my check in lugguge... 
I didn't lose it. Airline did. I checked it in. It nvr appeared thereafter 
@the12kingstar I'm ok. Just got back frm Bangkok, Thailand. Thats e good news. The bad news is that e Airline lost my check-in luggage.

Car remote refuses to behave after being dropped.  used method prescribed by Russian engineers. Give it a good bang. Voil√†!
@dawntoh same here, if only because we have no choice... 
@LouiseYourQueen U wld hv to go thru e trouble of losing ur luggage 1st &amp; the heartache + disappointment. i rlly thot it was gone 4 gd.  
@jerminho it would? seriously? 
@MuscleNerd you reckon a jailbroken iPhone at ver 2.2 can be upgraded to 3.0 and not be bricked? 
@lennel i hope its at 1am mate... my ears are going to get pulled if it if doesnt happen... 
@Shitizen I'm not fat. 
i can't seem to tether my iPhone via USB... 
@wynlim I looked at my network settings and I don't see anythig there... 
@inrsoul   not good. Especially when i came back from BKK on Monday afternoon...
It's heart rending to see ur own mom cry. Was just told tt we shld minimise our visits bc of her poor immune system. 
She crying frm the pain &amp; fear of it's getting worst. Sobs rack her body, already weakened by chemo. I've not felt so helpness for awhile 
Nursing a headache... Gaaaah 
@skinnylatte I share your frustrations... 
@lennel tried. Weird it doesn't work. 
@valska I always get humped by dogs 
Hates waking up in the middle of the night &amp; not able to fall asleep again. 
Feeling morose after sending wife off at the airport. 
@serenetan I got one too. 
Hates arguing on the iPhone or cellphones. There's no way to slam the phone down without causing yourself heartbreak. 
@ctham Lucky you.  Enjoy it.
@ctham good night... And good morning... 
@clicktokill watch Monster Inc on 5 now! 
@germaine my pleasure. I absolutely agree with u.  
@ctham  dont be too hard on yourself. 
@hanifn well, I do wish u all the best! 
@betshopboy Good luck for the run. 
@iro_ny trust me. Peaceful is good.  too much excitment can bad for the heart.

@betshopboy it's ok. Try again. 
@clicktokill hahaha... To sleep. You'll feel better when u wake.

Anyone knows where in Paris I can buy 2008 Bordeaux at a reasonable price? 
@iro_ny Morning 
@geekparrot Ok i guess. Hows your? Gotten use to the lack of camera on your ipod touch yet? 
@nikipaniki Well, all the best for your speech. 
@kopigao Well, i get decent shots out of my Nikon F601 (film) on a 50mm. no issues there.  But if u are leaning towards Canon, go for it.
@the12kingstar who asked if you were? 
@missbossy your mac book pro should have iPhoto.  good for making montages 
@feicho  why do you need to be in town? may need your help on 15 June. will provide more details later. 
@patlaw it's also abt user generated content with them sharing &amp; passing on info in both unadulterated as well as processed form? 
@allyrockstar take a power nap 
@jinnpod what book did u borrow? 
Good night Little Horny Kitty. May lice infest your pubic area. To friends, I bid u good night and pleasant dreams. 
@TheLonelyGnome yeah... He is 
@serenetan it all depends on the expectation of the involved parties 
@valska yeap. That's me 
@Qierann most certainly! 
@TheLonelyGnome what do u feel like? 
@betshopboy alrighty. Thank you. 
@ctham well, you made it true the day. That's the most important bit.

@MeiNg I'll settle for The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch instead. He is inspirational. 
@avalanchelynn a tailored shirt.  price can range frm $100 upwards, depending on material used. U get complete control over all aspect...
@avalanchelynn i.e. Style of collar, type of cuffs etc. The staff there are very helpful. 
@germaine an iPod touch or an iPhone would be handy. Or a book mayhaps? 
@highpriestess His books are alway a pleasure to read. 
@NeilHumphreys Relatively. ;) But it is intuitive.  Lemme know if you need any help.  would be happy to share. 
@juzferyou well, not all that cheap i reckon but cute... definitely.
