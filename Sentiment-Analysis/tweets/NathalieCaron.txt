@HeroesforAutism I wish I could go, but I'm in Montreal. Other side of the continent 
@ZacharyLeviNet I know, only 2 more  I have high hopes it will be back for a 3rd season! fingers crossed!
I wish I could have gone to Heroes for Autism. 
@SamanthaMulder @zachfelldown It's pretty depressing to think we have to wait until 2010 for #Lost to return 
@KristinaAwesome You're right. Is a huge BLAH! day. 
@Patti0713 I ate a Burger King Angus mushroom thing for comfort food. It was disgusting in not a very good way. 
@TheMightyFoz Somehow, I kinda like that new avi much better than the one just before. But I miss your warm and cuddly self 
@TheMightyFoz Ok. I Imdb'd her. I don't watch SNL and I don't recall seing her b4. I feel lame. 
@crazyTVaholic Not too bad. I'm so sorry about your back! 
@HireHeather It always scares me to go to the theatre because of guys like this. I'm so sad you're experience was almost ruined. 
@InEveryWordISay I need money too 
@Patti0713 It's not on my cable carrier. Only Space channel 
@wendilynnmakeup Your link is working. It's when I want to post my recommendation that it's not. It says error on page 
@SArmyPureEvil That sucks  #SArmy
@jhummrich I want to eat that *sigh* Just having a bowl of cereal. It's certainly not the same!   lol
@himynameisnick In retrospect, X3 would have been better with Singer indeed. Sad 
@SArmyPureEvil Me too. I used to eat a lot of them until that faithful day when I thought I would end up at the hospital, years ago 
@asexiness I love him to bits but as I asid earlier. NO. nonononononono. 
@chiniehdiaz I as disappointed about Angela's sis 
@HireHeather I don't like this hat either. I don't know why so much affection for it 
@Patti0713 Nothing much actually. Only the sad news about David Carradine 
@InEveryWordISay I'm happy for you. I need to work my butt off more! I only lost 6 pounds   Granted I need only to lose perhaps 10 more.
@InEveryWordISay Some are but the portions are so small. I'm always hungry. 
@Rikku819 The filet Migon was good though I overcooked it a bit 
@asexiness Oh Crap!!!!! That sucks 
@Patti0713 Sorry I didn't get to prepare you!! LOL Wish I could talk longer but I just popped in. Giving back the comp to my kid 
@NextOnHeroes I need to find a rich husband, or win the lotery 
@InEveryWordISay Morning! I worked my b**t off yestrday. Haven't lost a pound since last I weighed myself and I eat bettr. I don't get it 
@crazyTVaholic Oh crap!!!!! I weighed myself yesterday. Last time I weighed myself was 2-3 weeks ago. Not lost one pound 
Sorry guys I'm not much of a twitter this afternoon. I'm way over my head with work. 
@KristinaAwesome Never been to LA so I can't help you on that 
@InEveryWordISay I'm sorry about that 
@asexiness I'm sorry!!! I missed it too  I'm a bad person
@NextOnHeroes Thanks! I still kind of feel bad though. I've got so many tweets that I usually no longer go back to read them 
@taryn_gabrielle I don't want to think about it either. He's my favourite Doctor. It was a shock when he announced he was leaving. 
@NextOnHeroes Oh no! That sucks 
@Patti0713 Hahahaha! The plant head! It's raining here too.  It kinda sucks 
@Denyalle Oh no!!! That sucks! No new shoes 
@ebrown2112 I wish I could go to. Maybe we should form a club, for those like us, who wish they'd be there but cannot 
@Patti0713 I only see the pink color 
@KristinaAwesome She did. Then he went and married Scarlet instead of me. That sucks   LOL
@Denyalle I know nothing about blogs. 
@ilaam I will have to keep my mouth shut for 36 hours. That's very bad 
@Rikku819 I got Enterprise. Still waiting for Voyager   Rent s2 then
@supernatrell It's OK. I happen to like Enterprise. Except the whole Xindi storyline 
@Denyalle I din't find the number    If you climb his balcony, try putting on sensible shoes or none at all
@wendilynnmakeup I can never watch Wendi going to Comic-Con because it doesn't work in Canada it seems. 
@Denyalle You're lonely without the kids 
@TheLastDoctor You can say that again! No real season with you in it. Only sparse specials 
@Denyalle Yes, but why you want to put a disclaimer? This is too complicated for me!! I Don't know if I can do it!!!! 
@Rikku819 Really, I did not like it.  I was bored, bored, bored with the kid's story.
I have a splitting headache coming up. I can feel it. 
@Rikku819 LOL. Got to go outside soon. Have to pick up stuff like milk, bread, cat litter. 
@ilaam Me depressed right now 
@NextOnHeroes I'm depressed now 
@SArmyPureEvil Yes, we were all traumatized this afternoon 
@Denyalle Already put some!  Will take them off! LOL
From 8pm until way past 1am, there were 2 choppers circling in the sky above my head. Had to close windows to sleep even in hot weather 
@ilaam I'm going through Heroes withdrawal as well   Miss it a lot.
@Denyalle Good morning! It's hot and humid here. Clouds are forming for rain and thunderstorm later today 
@InEveryWordISay I don't know how to help! I feel helpless for you   I hope things will get better
@Denyalle I never liked B&amp;B myself much. Sorry 
@Patti0713 That SUCKS.   Too much rain is like not enough grrrr
@Rikku819 Fuccccccckkkkkk!!! That is so sad 
Farrah Fawcett just died. This is so sad. She was 62. R.I.P. 
@HeroesARG I'm afraid Patrick Swayze is not doing so well either 
@Sheindie I'm good. Things are moving along. Came back from lunch with the sad news 
@MegganW I decided on Sense and Sensibility, the recent mini-series . . 
@asexiness Isn't he pretty like that?
